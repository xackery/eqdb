700AG	199 A.G.`   Zebuxoruk the Demigod`` In past time did a great `necromancer rise to `greatness. Kotiz was he.`He was once the apprentice`of the Shissar. It is there`that he learned the secrets`of the dark circle. After `the Green Death took the`Shissar, Kotiz made their`laboratories and libraries`his own. There did he train`many new apprentices.` In the year 199 A.G. he`finds a rip in time and`journeys to the netherworlds.`There he discovers the `trapped soul of an ancient`evil, the demigod, `Zebuxoruk.``` Zebuxoruk was imprisoned`for blasphemy and his `essence now was trapped `within a crystal. Kotiz was`promised great knowledge in`exchange for assisting`the demigod in his freedom.`Kotiz was told to return to`his world and gather 100`necromancers and bring them`one at a time to the crystal`where Kotiz would sacrifice`them using the crystal as`the sacrificial dagger.` Knowing only of his own`brood, Kotiz brought them`one after one to be `sacrificed to the demigod.`Upon the death of the last`apprentice did the crystal`shatter. A shard imbedded`itself in the shoulder of `Kotiz. There was no demigod`to be seen.` The tiny plane began to`fold in upon itself. Kotiz`escaped using the last mana`he had. He believed he was `deceived by the demigod. He`destroyed his own brood for`naught. Suddenly the shard`of crystal in Kotiz began to`move under the skin. It rushed`to his right arm. With great`pain, arms began to sprout`from his own arm. They `grabbed Kotiz's shoulder and`ripped his arm from his `socket and began to form a`demonic creature. `Zebuxoruk was free! He lay `a book in front of the `dying necromancer and `left in a flash of light. `The book was The Unholy Writ`of War. Each page was made`from the skin of the `sacrificed brood. `Kotiz repaired himself and`hid the book in a tesseract`within his library. There`it would remain. Eventually`Kotiz could sustain his life`no longer. He entered death`                700 A.G.	0
ABYBrewingRecipeB	Making Sauces` by Galidnus```Honestly, I just don't have`time to do this.  There are`some fantastic new teas to `try out and I don't want to`waste my time writing, but `Chowderly insisted, so here`it is.  I'm sorry if this `is short.``I'll tell you how to make `one of my favorite sauces, `lemon-butter.  It's really `not all that hard, though `Chowderly would like you to`think it is.``Take some butter and mix it`with some white wine.  The `proportions are for you to `decide.  Add a lemon.  We `have a good supply of `lemons on board, so finding`them shouldn't be an issue.` It's just that simple.``I've come up with several `easy recipes for sauces to `keep Chowderly busy, such `as a simple grilling sauce,`a spiced sauce, a smoking `sauce, a butter sauce, a `garlic-butter sauce, a `barbeque sauce, a beer `braising sauce and even a `beer-batter.``Now, if I were writing for `my fellow brewers, I'd tell`you something about the `Taelosian teas.  A `wonderful tea that accepts `a lot of flavors very well.` Try it with mint!  To make`some of the darker teas, `you'll need to find some `ingredients out on `Taelosia.  Look for moldy `leaves to give an earthy `flavor for a black tea, or `some tea plant sticks and `greener leaves for a green `tea.``Anyhow, I've got to get to `work.  If Chowderly wants `to prattle on about his new`tuna recipes, let him spend`his own time at it.`	-1
ABYFletchingRecipeB	The Beauty of a Simple Stone`  by Bansama Nysawi``I am a simple person and I `find beauty in the simple `things.  I've been a `crafter for a long time `now.  When I was a girl I `found joy in making arrows `for my father and his `friends, and to this day I `still find making things to`be the most rewarding `activity in my life.``Recently, we discovered a `new stone, hard as any `rock, but with interesting `shearing properties.  If `you break it just the right`way you will get an edge `sharper than any steel.  `We've called this material `Taelosian Stone.  We've `also found a version of `this stone that has been `altered by some tremendous `force, and we've decided to`call that Discord Stone.  `It has the same properties `as Taelosian Stone, but it `has unusual additional `properties that I can't `fully describe.``Not only is this stone `beautiful, it is very `useful.``Once the stone is prepared `(and that's a secret for `another tome and another `time), careful use of a `file will produce a `wonderful new arrowhead.  `Make sure to keep the stone`wet while you work with it.``Using even common shafts, `fletchings, and nocs, and `it produces some wonderful `arrows.`	-1

ABYTailoringRecipeB	My Theory About Muramites`  by Garald Samer, Master `Tailor```I have been honored to be `master tailor here on the `Queen of Thorns.  I have `been extremely busy, but `Morden has asked us to try `to write our discoveries `down whenever we can.  For `a barbarian, he is `surprisingly interested in `written records.``Adventurers have been `returning to the ship with `these unusual, rune-etched `scales.  They tell me that `they were part of the armor`that these so-called `Muramites wear.  At first I`just shrugged and accepted `that as fact, but now that `I have examined these `scales more closely, I have`some concerns.``They appear to be organic `scales, marked with some `writing or runes that `nobody can decipher.  `That's certainly strange, `but that isn't what bothers`me.  From what I and others`can tell, these scales seem`to have all come from the `same creature.  Not only `that, but they do not come `from any kind of animal or `being that anyone seems to `recognize.  The coloration `and texture are, well, off.` I can't explain it better `than that.``I know leather and skin `better than almost anyone. `My examination of hundreds `of these scales has me very`worried.  From what I can `see, they have all come not`from a single family of `large creatures, but from `one beast in particular.  I`can't prove that, of `course, but if I am right, `this is a frightening `concept.``This creature must either `shed scales at a horrifying`rate, or it is so large `that upon killing it, these`Muramites were able to `outfit their entire army `with armor from its scales.` If these creatures killed `a creature of that size, `then I'm very concerned `about our chances of `defeating them.``There is a positive side to`this, though.  These scales`are a very useful material.` I have been dedicating `myself to studying the `scales themselves, and `between Tonlyei and I, we `have been able to put them `to use.  We have created a `few new whips using these `scales that have potential.` We have tried reinforcing `them with thread made from `the new steel that has been`discovered as well, but we `discovered that the steel `would eventually damage the`whip.  We found that `treating the steel with the`blood of a hynid will `lubricate it well and `reduce the damage.``Of course whips can be made`from cat or wolf pelts, `even the skins of those `horrible brute on Taelosia `will work, but the etched `scales are amazing.  It `takes more skill to create `a whip from the scales, but`the result is worth it.``We have also been working `with the hides of the `Taelosian animals and have `found them to be very good `for making backpacks, `though they are much `stronger if you bind them `with the new steel (treated`properly, of course).  Of `the two types of thread the`smiths have made, one they `call "aligned" and the `other "shimmering" steel, `the shimmering thread is `much stronger, though a `little thicker and harder `to work with.  They also `tend to make it a bit `longer than the aligned `thread.  If used carefully,`I can use less shimmering `steel thread to make a more`durable bag.``I suppose I should return `to work.  It has been nice `to set pen to paper again.`	-1
ABYTinkeringRecipeB	A New Energy Source` by Tialechaety Orrthemech```I am here on the Queen of `Thorns, just outside of `Taelosia.  I have recently `been working with a new `material that has been `recovered from Taelosia.  `As the first to examine `this material, Skelontorim `and I have chosen to name `it Dark Matter.  It is `black and has very little `hint of color or shine.  We`have also discovered that `there are two separate `forms of this material.  `The rarer form has been `infused with some other `matter.  To the best of our`knowledge at this time, `that matter is somehow `linked to the augment `stones, though only `tenuously.  We have named `this form Infused Dark `Matter.``This is a dangerous `material.  It holds power `and improper handling can `be harmful, as Skelontorim `recently discovered.  For `now, our research is `limited but our location, `the supplies and time `available to us.  We have `been asked to attempt only `experiments that we are `certain will not cause any `other large explosions.  We`have, however, discovered a`method for harnessing the `power of Dark Matter.``The key is in the `refinement process.  We `have shared that procedure `with a select few, but I `shall not write it out `here.  Once processed, it `is a relatively simple `matter to divide the Dark `Matter into smaller `portions, any good tinkerer`can do that in her toolbox.` Once you have the proper `amount of matter, just `place it into the battery `casings that we designed `and made available.  These `casings, with the Dark `Matter to power them, can `replace any Mana Battery.  `The only exception is the `larger and more powerful `level six battery.  To `create something to replace`one of these, you must use `the Infused Dark Matter.`	-1

AIRBrdBk1	Agilmente's Flute```He came to me one day and`propositioned me to create him`an instrument that would be sung`about for years to come. It was`to produce the most beautiful`sound, forever resonating in the`ears and minds of others.  I did`craft the flute and it was used`by him for many a year.`Upon his death, it was sung`about until the day it fell into`the hands of the Vampire.`The flute was destroyed, and`whilst the Vampire reveled at`its destruction.`Somehow a shrieking chord was`sprung forth from the flute`even as it was destroyed.`The sounds carried throughout`the land and many a bard heard`it.`It has since been heard, for`all Bards will play this chord`in honor of the beauty of the`flute lost. To this day, the`Vampire stares out his window,`and forever hear with his`exceptional ears, the sound`of the flute.	-1

AIRClrBk1	Musings of a Priest``The healing touch is not one that`is always easily mastered.  Any`improper weave in the conjugation`of a healing type spell can`actually do the reverse and cause`damage. This is done primarily`from carelessness but often shows`an aptitude towards the darker`magicks which must be avoided at`all costs.`I find that many such people `often practice the dark art of`necromancy. Our weaves are very`similar, in fact, in comparison`to the weaves used by Javzov`Natoruz, a Erudite Necromancer`whom I had the distinct pleasure`of interrogating some time ago,`the weaves I heal with and those`he uses to cause decay are near`mirror images.  He was helpful`while on Lord Bayle's rack.`It has been since this time, that`myself and my order have begun to`search out candidates for the`order after comprehensively`testing them by funneling a bit`of spirit into them and viewing`the effect. In most cases, the`individual will show a rather`unremarkable affect, however, in`some cases we were able to view`a distinct pattern alteration.``In this particular case, the`subject was then not admitted`as a candidate and has since`taken up the dark arts, which in`my opinion, is perfect proof`for my hypothesis. It should be`something that is looked into by`the order at once.``Fejorus Eptalruj`High Priest, the Tribunal.	-1

AIRDruidBk1	Flowing Black Robes``It was a very calm day in the`Karanas and the plains' namesake`was blessing the land with a`bountiful amount of rain.  The`land grew silent as the rain`trailed off and the calls of`wildlife could be heard for`miles.  Suddenly, a distant cry`was heard and the sound of`cackling bones hit the man's ear.`He sprinted to the origin of the`sound, paying little heed to the`cuts and scratches he received`from running through the`brambles.  On scene he saw a`Teir'Dal dressed in a brilliant`black robe which to him appeared`to be flowing. At his side was an`abomination of bones, fiercely`fighting a noble treant. The`treant fought valiantly but`seemed to be outmatched.`The treant tried one last`desperate attempt to save`himself. He called to the sky and`soon after, a rain of hail`descended upon the Teir'Dal`and his hideous pet. The Teir'dal`fell back, and the man struck`from the brambles, taking the dark`one off guard. The two spent time`in a close-quartered fight whilst`the Treant dispatched the`Teir'dal's summoned abomination.`The Teir'dal fell that day, and`the man was rewarded with a`blessing from the living forest`itself.	-1
AIRDruidBk2	The Blessing of Tunare``This story begins many years`ago when I was a child.  I had`wandered away from our village`and could not find my way back.`I spent many a day in the`forest, subsisting on grubs and`berries. I found myself near`death, and knew that I could do`nothing but pray that my journey`to the beyond would be swift.`I think she came to me in the`form of a wolf.  She licked my`wounds, and it was at that time`I felt renewed. I got to my feet`and stared at her in complete`awe. Never before had I seen an`animal which carried itself in`this manner.  Its regal face`stared back at me, tilting its`head to the side to better`evaluate me. I chuckled briefly` in response.`The wolf turned a bit of a smile`as its lips flared a bit,`showing its sharp and pointed`canines.  The wolf ended up`leaving, but from that point`in my life, I knew my calling.`The wolf could very well have`slain me as I lay there weak,`but instead, gave me a new`life. This life is the life I`still walk to this day.``I feel a peace that I do not`even believe that the spiritual`monks have obtained.  It is`with her blessing that I walk`these lands, protecting them,`guarding them, renewing them.	-1
AIREnchBk1	The Power of Suggestion`The ability of an enchanter to`cause others to succumb to their`will is an incredible asset. It`is not as easy as it seems`however.  An enchanter must first`know the name of the person whom`they wish to cast upon.  Then,`they must win a battle of wills`with their intended victim. If`victorious, the person is now`under the enchanter's control.`It is at this time that an`enchanter's true nature shows`itself.  If evil, the enchanter`will use this power to extort`favors or in extreme cases, use`the person as an assassin.`Enchanters of a goodly nature`find the invasion of another's`mind both morally and ethically`wrong, and will only use their`powers in self-defense.	-1
AIREnchBk2	Invisible Men and Their Uses``We have within our power`the ability to summon forth`from the Plane of Air an`invisible servant.  This servant`is skilled in the ways of battle,`can serve as a personal servant`around the house, and is great at`aiding in the carrying of spell`components while in the rough.``First, lets take a look at the`invisible man's combat`capabilities.  Offensively, they`do not provide the punch the`mages' elementals happen to`provide.  However, they do excel`at the art of defense, which can`be incredibly useful in, shall we`say, sticky  circumstances.`Many enchanters use only this,`never realizing the many`potentials for these servants.`Second, the invisible man can aid`an enchanter at home.  Imagine,`a mute person you cannot see`that cleans everything almost`before it was dirtied in the`first place.  He is also useful`as a package carrier while taking`that trip down to the market.`For those more adventurous`enchanters, the invisible man`is also an invaluable travelling`companion.`On the road, the invisible man`serves as both bodyguard and`mule.  He carries your travel`supplies, and if you are set upon`by bandits in the Karanas, he is`more than able to fend them off`while you gate back to Erudin.	-1
AIRFalStry	The Tale of Falorn Sargus``  Falorn was born a lusty lad in`the frozen plains of the`Everfrost. As he grew, he`outstripped his peers in both`stature and wits.`  In his tenth year, Falorn's`tribe was slaughtered by orcs.`For an unknown reason the orc`chieftain spared  Falorn, and`took him as his personal slave.`  Though the chief was a cruel and`torturous master, Falorn thrived`under him.  Time passed and the`hardships forged Falorn into a`powerful warrior.`  Falorn became free in his eighth`year of enslavement.  The orcan`tribe sought shelter in what`appeared to be an empty cave`during a severe snowstorm.  The`hibernating glacial bear within`awoke and tore through the orcs.`While the orcs scattered, Falorn`scrambled for a weapon. He found`an axe one of them had discarded`in his hurry to escape the`enraged bear.  Falorn grabbed the`axe and carefully took aim.  His`arm sprang forward like a coiled`spring and the axe tumbled`through the air towards the`enraged beast.  With a meaty thwack,`the axe lodged in the base of the`bear's skull, killing it.  Grim-`faced, Falorn went to the bear`pulled his axe from the`carcass and strode away.`  Now free, Falorn went south.`It was not long before tales`spread of a tall barbarian`berserker who could not be`defeated.  Years passed, and both`Falorn's skills and fame grew.`After nearly a decade, Falorn`returned to the frozen wastes`of Everfrost a scarred and`grizzled veteran of many battles.`  As he traversed the frozen`tundra, Falorn met with the Ice`Wolf Northman tribe. Falorn`traveled with the Ice Wolves for`a time and decided to join them.`  Falorn approached the`tribe elders and stated his`intent.  The elders named Falorn`worthy and presented him with`three tests, the tests of`strength, skill and force.`  Falorn accepted, and after much`toil won his right to join the`Ice Wolf tribe.	0

AIRMagiBk1	The Power of Two`A magician has many tools at his`or her disposal.  Oftentimes a`magician can accomplish tasks`that many others cannot. This is`done by the ability to summon`anything and everything that he`or she would need.  A magician is`self-sufficient, and can maintain`his or her own existence`completely bereft of the`assistance of others.`It is rare to see a magician that`is not followed by an elemental.`This summoning is but one of many,`but is obviously the most`beneficial to the caster. These`elementals come in a variety of`shapes and in a variety of sizes,`each unique in its own way.  A`wise magician will have a variety`of elemental summonings in his`spell arsenal, and will use each`as the situation demands.  The`most notable use of these`elementals is in battle.  For if`a magician knows his enemy's`weakness, it is very likely that`he has an elemental that will`exploit it.``Gwysan FireHand`High Enchanter of Ak'Anon	-1
AIRMagiBk2	The Existence of Essence``It is channeling the caster's`essence that allows him to `conjure items from nothing.

It will`be of a much lower quality.`The item may even dissipate into`nothingness if the caster is`tired or attempting to summon`something beyond his skill.  `As a caster's essence becomes`more refined, he is able to`attempt intricate summonings.`Some of the most prominent`magicians have been able to`summon up incredible items`of power that are permanent`fixtures in the world.	-1

He surveyed the field,`a field of bones and flesh, a`flash of ivory could be seen`deep within the cowl of the robe`as he smiled to himself.`He knew that his lord had grown`in strength this day.  The figure`began arranging the bodies of the`slain, collecting pieces suitable`for his creation.  He uttered a`few words in prayer to his dark`lord, the Prince of Hate, and he`went into motion.  The corpse,`lifeless before him, arose,`no more a man, but an abomination,`animated by the sheer will of the`man and the power of his lord.`This day, the field was littered`with bones and flesh.

AIRWizBk2	Channeling``Once one has mastered the art of`projecting one's will upon the`plane, one is then able to learn`to channel this power and use it`to its utmost effectiveness.`With this having been said, it`is important to remember then,`that the channeling of specific`magikal energy can be a dangerous`endeavor.  A wizard must always`remember to focus his energies to`a point when directly casting`upon one other individual. If you`were to mischannel any amount of`energy, you would risk damaging`both you and your companions.`If the intention is to cause a`widespread amount of destruction`then it is important to channel a`wide range of essence.`This manner of attack is often`more exhausting and will require`a great deal of concentration`whilst casting. It is imperative`then that you always be aware of`your current essence, and gauge`your opponents well.	-1

Sightings `include long dead dragons `coming to life, nightmarish `beings of ineffable evil and `various other toothy monstrous`horrors.``Travelers in the area should `exercise extreme caution when `navigating this region.``----------------------------`Freaks in Northern Ro`----------------------------``In the Northern Deserts of Ro,`a group known as the Followers`of Tishe Virm has made an `appearance. Apparently there `for a feast which takes place `only every other (human) `generation, they are `attempting to call forth the `being they call Tishe Virm.``The method they use to attempt`to do this is rather `disturbing. Apparently, they `soak corpses in a solution and`then plant them in the ground.`Then through some horribly `malign magic, they grow fungus`and rise from the dead. The `fungus is used to entice this `Tishe Virm thing out of `hibernation. Freaks!``Our local scholars have `uncovered even more disturbing`news! It seems that the feast `is not what they claim. The `feast is apparently for this `Tishe Virm thing with the main`course being the attendees of `said feast. We urge travellers`to the eastern coast of `Antonica to avoid this `festival if they know what is `good for them.	0
AKAProject	--Project - Tourists Beware!--``A Lobal Postugger Manifesto`-editing done by`Lobal's Missus```The filth of Norrath has been floodin into the gates of Ak`Ankon for long enough.

We been watchin as our Watchmen have been terrorized and our clockworks been bashed apart.`These gangly terrors are the same ones that come into our fair city and try to sell us their garbage and trinkets.  WELL NO MORE!``The Deep Muses, lead by the Dreaded Scourge, Lobal Postugger, are liberatin the city of Ak'Anon.  We are going to implement a strategic three-pronged plan to drive the nasty creatures from our town.  The three steps are as follows.  Keep them secret.  The future of Ak'Anon depends on you!`-- --`Step 1.  Get the plans for Type XII-b Devices from Gimzol Grimgear and then return this book to me to show that you are ready for step two.`-- --`Step 2.  Create enough Type XII-b Devices to blow up all six of the Guide Clockworks that can be found in Ak'Anon.  Take the devices and place them in the bag that I gave you.`-- -- `Step 3.  Place the Type XII-b Devices in each of the clockworks and then place the Old Clockwork parts in the bag that I gave you.  Once the bag is filled, lock the hasp on the bag and bring it back to me.  That will show me that we are ready to begin the liberation of Ak'Anon.`-- -- `Step 4. -tentative- Build a lockable door at the Ak'Anon entrance and don't give anyone that looks 'untrustworthy' the key.`-- --````The goal here is to destroy all of those helpful Guide Clockworks.  This should leave any tourist completely confused and unable to find their way around our town.  Given the complex layout of town, any tourists that come in should become discouraged at their inability to find anything and leave immediately.``We will be free soon.

AKAProject2	Gizmol's notes:`---  ---  ---  --- ---``To create a Type XII-b Device you will need to get an Airtight Cog Box from a Muckscrubber Unit.  This box will contain the device.  Combine 1 bottle of Firewater, some Metal Twine, a W.R.U. and a regular bandage from any merchant.  The Working Remote Unit can be found in some of the rogue cleaners that roam Steamfont.``Combine the components in the Airtight Cog Box and you should have no problem creating a Type XII-b Device.  Take care not to drop the device once you have put it together and sealed it.``The device has the power to burn all of the flesh from your bones in a matter of seconds.

AKHBook1	I begin to wonder if I'll ever`make it out of here with my `soul intact.  Each day the `shades seem to tear a piece of`my soul away.  The rest of my `party also seems to be `effected by our travels `through the ruins.  Bauric `seems especially troubled by `our time here.  He keeps `playing with the robes that `the shades leave behind when `we kill them, although "Kill" `isn't very accurate.  They `simply seem to fade into the `stone floors when they're `weakened.  Bauric insists on `carrying all the lengths of `material that they leave.  I `refuse to touch them. There is`something unnatural about the `essence of these ghosts.  I `have little choice as to our `supply of food however.  The `Centi is barely tolerable even`when drenched in sauce and `spices.  I can't even bare to `watch Bauric eat the stew he `makes with the toes.  I'd tell`him not to waste the milk and `spices, but it seems to give `him energy and determination. `Something I have very little `of left.	16
AKHBook2	Bauric has gone completely `insane now.  Yesterday we were`attacked by some kind of worm `like creature.  The smaller `ones weren't too much trouble `but the larger ones nearly `overcame us.  Perhaps my time `in the ruins has played with `my sanity, but I would have `sworn that I could feel the `worm's presence in my mind.  `Stealing my essence and my `sanity.  I am now almost `certain that I'll never make `it out of here with my `humanity.  Sometimes I hear a `great rumbling beneath the `stone floors, as if some great`beast is moving beneath the `earth.  ``Bauric has taken to sewing the`hides of the giant worms on to`the material from the shades. `He has nearly an entire set of`clothing made from them now.  `How he can stand to touch the `hides I'll never know.	16
Alc1	Dearest Allyssa,`    I'm writing to you to`say that I am well. I have`reached Halas and met the`local medicine man (or`"Shaman" as he refers to`himself). He's a rough sort,`but has a good nature, and`his manner with those who`are brought to him is as fine`and caring as I would hope`for from any of my students.`Convincing him to allow me`to study his use of herbs and`potions has been difficult in`the extreme. To his people,`he is as much a member of the`clergy as any Priest of`Mithaniel Marr is to us, and`his treatments are deeply`held as sacred mysteries. We`spent a full night of eating`and drinking (these barbar-`ians are a rough lot) without`success, although he seemed`impressed that a "city man"`could match his pace at`imbibing.``Indeed, I had almost des-`paired of doing so until the`next morning. Waking with a`severe headache from my`excesses the night before, I`blearily made my way from my`hut to meet him. Initially`amused at my state, he threw`a dried rat ear and a root I`recognized as alkanet (a`general folk remedy chewed`for aches in these parts)`into a medicine bag and pro-`ceeded to pulp the root to a`liquid.  Pouring the noisome`concoction into a mug, he`handed it to me. Not wishing`to appear effete, I drank`readily (if without enthu-`siasm) and a more disgusting`flavor is hard to imagine.`However, my pains left me`entirely within seconds, as`did any remaining intox-`ication.``He told me that he had`developed this "Somber`Origins" so that he could`recover his sobriety quickly`in order to treat unexpected`patients on feast nights,`when young bravos are prone`to fighting. With a wink, he`also confided that those same`young men were quite fond of`his "Charming Deceit", an`unlikely combination of un-`dead froglok tongue and`mugwart, which aided them in`impressing the ladies of the`village.`Please write and tell me you`are well.`    Your Jonas	-1
Alc2	Dearest Allyssa,``    I was overjoyed to`receive your letter, but dis-`mayed yet again over the`words your father had for me.`My resolve to learn pharma-`copoeial skills to make me a`prestigious consultant and worthy`of your hand in his eyes has`only redoubled.``My education proceeds, as my`host allows me to observe his`treatments and preparations.`Today a party of hunters`came. They were preparing for`a long expedition to the Icy`Plains. Apparently these are`as frigid as they sound, as`the group was dressed in warm`furs, even though these same`men face the frozen avenues`of Halas in no more than a`kilt and a pair of boots.``I was reminded of just how`chill this was as I was sent`out to the shops to find`certain leaves and skins`(cold enough to wrap myself`in uncured skins). When`I returned, my mentor`arranged these on his bench`where a couple of jars had`been already opened. I`watched with interest as he`proceeded.``First he removed a multi-`colored faerie wing (I`forbore asking how he got it)`and combined it with`Yebamante to create what he`referred to as "Troll's`Essence". I asked why it was`called that when there was no`part of a troll in it, he`said it was just how it had`come to be called. Apparently`this brew enhances the`martial skills and con-`stitution of those who take`it.``Reucoat's leaves were matched`with an odoriferous piece of`zombie flesh, to create`"Spurn Affliction."  Somehow`the Reucoat reversed the`effect of the putrid flesh,`actually armoring the drinker`against disease.``Then a piece of wolf skin of`the highest quality was cut`from the hide, and combined`with sticklewort. The`resulting "Wolves Blood" was`apparently intended as an`energizer, reducing the need`to rest from strenuous`activity. Certainly hunting`in these climes is always`strenuous.``I am sure that the skills I`am learning will serve me`well, and look forward eagerly`to your next letter.`    Your Jonas	-1
Alc3	Dearest Allyssa,``    I was saddened to hear of`your sister's accident, and`fervently hope that she is`well again when this missive`reaches you.  It is shameful`that the sunken portions of`the dock area have never been`fenced or railed for the`safety of passersby.  I saw`no end of injuries like hers`in my practice, and expect`that there will be many more.``I am doing very well, and`have found the cold mornings`much more endurable since my`patron instructed me in the`creation of the "Frosty`Insurgency" solution from`polar bear skin and Bistort.`It is amazing how preferable`this is to the usual`barbarian method of dealing`with cold (which is to drink`one's self to a semi-stupor,`beyond caring of the`weather).``Recently I managed to reverse`things and teach my host a`lesson in medicine, when a`small child was attacked by a`giant wooly spider and`poisoned before the nearby`patrol could arrive and dis-`patch it.  The "Gorging`Toxin" he made from a giant`wasp venom sac and boneset`herb was not sufficient to`neutralize the arachnid's`venom and he lacked the`ingredients for a stronger`brew.  However, my mundane`approach of lancing and`draining the bite to draw`the poison made the`difference (I doubt it would`have done alone, so strong is`the bite of that creature)`and the child lived, much to`the appreciation of her`father (who nearly cleft me`with an axe when I made the`incision).``In gratitude he brought out`his rarest component, Vox's`Dust and showed me how to`blend it with a ground fire`drake scale to make the`"Skin of Ro" specific against`heat and flame.  It was`impressively effective,`allowing him to stand in the`flames of a bonfire without`harm even as his clothing`scorched and burned.``Please give my best to your`sister and mother, and my`respects to your father.``    Your Jonas	-1
Alc4	Dearest Alyssa,``    Fortified by Frosty`Insurgency potions, I have`begun exploring more of the`area, traveling with hunting`parties as they go out to`bring in the food for the`village. And such beasts they`hunt, mammoths as big as`houses, white leopards with`black spots, creatures I had`only read about and sometimes`not even believed.``Hunting the mammoth,`especially, is a difficult`undertaking. One party had a`novel approach, taking along`Gnomish Boils solution`(a combination of bat fur`and eyebright), they`surprised a cow mammoth at`night (which the solution`turned nearly to day), in a`scene of slaughter that was`too much for me.  Another`group, however, was even more`amazing, they went swimming`for fish, using Vox's`Vitality (froglok leg and sea`spirit) to remain underwater`for incredible lengths of`time, with no apparent need`to breathe.  Once again I was`amazed at the hardiness of`these people, as they`literally had to cut holes in`the ice in order to reach the`water and swim!``Even so, the men came out of`the water even more exhausted`than Wolves Blood could`repair, as they immediately`visited my host for an even`stronger brew made of white`wolf skin and burdock root`(called fleeting languor),`before taking themselves to`McQuaid's for more`traditional libations.`With any luck, this letter`finds your sister well, and`you as well as always.  As`always, I wish you and yours`(even your father) my best,`and hope that I may soon be`able to return.``Your Jonas	-1
Alc5	Dearest Alyssa,``    Truly I was overjoyed to`hear that your sister has`recovered, apparently without`permanent harm.  She is, as`you, of fundamentally healthy`nature, and it served her`well in her recovery. I hope`that she will be more careful`in the future, however.``Myself, life has settled into`something of a routine, even`the exotic becomes familiar`with time I am finding. In an`effort to see something new`and different, I went seeking`that shyest of creatures, the`air elemental.  Although an`invader of our plane much`like the fire elementals of`Lavastorm, it is not`aggressive but retiring, not`even visible except when`defending itself. ``To find it, I prevailed upon`my host to show me the way of`combining feathers and`stinging nettle to create a`potion called Soul of the`Incorporeal.  This substance`makes the normally invisible`visible, and with it I was`able to see the flighty but`insubstantial sprites.  They`seemed to be very amused`with themselves, playing tag`from one side of the Icy`Plains to the other, almost`like children.``However, I also witnessed a`most primitive spectacle that`day, fortified by another of`my host's concoctions made of`warbone chips and damiana`leaves, one of the hunters`wrestled a small bear with`his bare hands.  The Undead's`Recourse solution certainly`seemed effective, as he won`rather handily, even though`this "small" bear was 3 times`even his own rather`impressive size.``I found the elementals to be`better company, especially`after partaking of Gulon's`Impunity (made from ground `figwort and and a minor `lightstone) which allowed me, `believe it or not, to sport `through the air with ease, `joining in their games.  ``However, when the fun `was over I used Copal's Demise`(evil eye eyestalk and `horehound) to dissipate the `magical effect, so that I `could return on my own feet.``As always, I await the day`when we may be together`again.``Your Jonas	-1

Ardathium1	These brief details are`conclusions drawn by me`in my brief encounter with`the ruins of this lost`citadel. I cannot claim any`word of this to be absolute`truth, for the information I`had available was vague,`if not cryptic through the`impenetrable veil of`ignorance and time that`shadowed my vision.`Throughout the whole of`Norrath's libraries and`scholars, I was not able to`find a single shred of`evidence or legend relating`to this place. Eerily, it was`as if it had never existed,`that the memory of Norrath`itself had torn Ardathium`from its mind. ``Ardathium - that is the name`of the place I shall detail`as best I can in these pages.`A glorious citadel`constructed by the first`followers of Mithaniel Marr`in what is now known as the`Southern Desert of Ro. I know`for certain that this place`exists, or existed, though in`unfortunate, irreparable ruin`beneath the unforgiving sands`of the desert. I have been`there, and I have seen it.`I cannot tell you where or`how to enter this place, for`I was forced to leave`prematurely during my`investigation of the site.`An earthquake forced me to`escape, or be buried alive`with the city's forgotten`dead. Unfortunately, the`earth swallowed the`city further into its belly,`the topmost portion of`Ardathium's tower was buried`deep beneath the sands once`more. I cannot say when or if`the city will rise again`through the will and labor`of united men and it would be`the wasted energies of a fool`to hope for as much within`our lifetimes.``In the two and a half days`that I was allotted the`opportunity to explore the`standing portions of this`place, I learned so little`and yet, so much. A great`library had once been housed`within the walls of the white`and golden city of Truth.`Though most of the tomes`have dissolved into dust in`the cruel clutches of time, I`was fortunate to find a few`legible documents, preserved`by the desert's heat. The`script was ancient, but I`recognized bits and pieces`of the runic tongue of old.`This story is one that I have`concluded to be a possible`fate of Sir Grenic Drere, the`hero of our tale, and the`fate of the city of`Ardathium. `	0
Ardathium2	In the first years to crown`the Monument Age, the`Fortress of Ardathium was`erected in the northernmost`fields outside the Elddar`Forest. Established by the`half elven paladin, Countess`Viannay, Ardathium would`be the first of the great`monuments established`in the name of Mithaniel Marr`throughout all of Norrathian`history. Dedicated solely to`the crusades of The`Truthbringer in the name of`valor, honor, and truth,`Ardathium was one of`Norrath's most beautiful,`though tragically short-lived`treasures. ``Constructed of`pure alabaster stone and`crowned in statues and`tower caps of solid gold,`Ardathium was a sight to`behold. Its white and blue`banners rose high toward the`heavens and the brilliant`glinting of sunlight off of`its tower's golden caps could`be seen for miles above the`lush, green canopy of the`Elddar Forest to the south.```The Che Virtuson was`established shortly `thereafter - an elite force `of zealous knights and `priests dedicated to The`Truthbringer and his divine`word. A small commune of `faithful peasants dwelled`within the outer sanctum of`the fortress' temple, though`the fortress was primarily`governed as a war-front`against the dark evils that`lurked in the eastern swamps`of Innothule and the`Feerrott. Countess Viannay`appointed three Viscounts to`her aid, dubbing each of them`a General of the Che Virtuson`and second in command to`only her dominion over`Ardathium.`Grenic Drere, a human paladin`of Marr who had led several`knights and faithful pilgrims`to Viannay's aid during the`first battles with the troll`armies of the east, was among`those appointed to lead at`her side. ``Ardathium would launch`several campaigns against the`massive trollish armies that`dwelled in the swamps of`Innothule to the east.`Countess Viannay's fervent`regard of the amphibious`race as a poisonous plague`upon the face of Norrath and`her military prowess in`conjunction with her`unchallenged zealous faith in`The Truthbringer would lead`the Che Virtuson to several`victories over their enemies`-- all the in the name of`Mithaniel Marr. `Unfortunately, Countess`Viannay would not live to`see the end of her life's`work and her death would be`the first step toward the`glorious fortress' demise`several generations later.`	0
Ardathium3	During one of the greatest`battles that Ardathium had`mounted against the trolls of`Innothule, Countess Viannay`fell terminally ill to a foul`curse placed upon her by one`of the powerful troll shamans,`Tjarduugh. Unable to lead her`armies and confined to her`bed chambers, Countess`Viannay handed the reins of`her armies to the Viscounts`while the high priests`struggled to counter the`curse. After a mere fortnight`of battle, Grenic Drere was`the only remaining general of`the Che Virtuson and the war`had seemed to turn to an`inevitable defeat within the`clutches of the infectious`shadow. His desire to`avenge the Countess was`overwhelming and upon`the final moments of her`life, Grenic vowed to fulfill` Viannay's life's work.``The Countess' body was to`be preserved through the`magic of the priests and`laid to final rest in the`grand mausoleum that`housed all of Ardathium's`heroes in the highest`tower of the fortress.`In the largest chamber of`the tower mausoleum,`Countess Viannay's body`was placed upon a raised`platform of alabaster and`gold. She was dressed in`ceremonial garb of silk and`chain-linked armor and held`beneath her hands, folded`over her breast, was the hilt`of her holy blade. Her body`was covered with Soraviene's`Veil - an artifact that would`kill any creature whose faith`was not solely bound to honor`and virtue that dared to`touch it.``With the Countess laid to`rest, Grenic ascended to hold`the title of count over all`of Ardathium. His vow to his`mistress would become the`consuming goal that gave`meaning to his life. Two`massive campaigns would be`launched beneath Grenic's`command against the trolls.``The loss of their Countess`had fuelled a passion that`acted as an impenetrable`shield upon all souls of the`Che Virtuson, and they were`victorious. The troll`warlord, a shadowknight`known as Kzurott, and`his forces were pushed out`of the plains upon the`first campaign, and the`second would lead to the`knight's demise. However,`this victory would seem`hollow, for Tjarduugh, the`high shaman that had ended`the life of their beloved`Countess, remained and`much of the troll army`still stood.	0
Ardathium4	No doubt fell upon Grenic's`mind that Tjarduugh would`launch an attack that would`more than likely cripple`Ardathium, if not destroy it.`His men were weary and few`amidst their immeasurable`bravery and honor. The attack`could not occur if Ardathium`were to survive, and above`all things, Grenic's vow to`Viannay was held in the`foremost of all his`considerations. ``He ordered the pilgrims to`leave Ardathium for their`own safety, vowing to`them that they would hear`word when and if it was`safe for them to return.`The Che Virtuson were`then organized and prepared`to act as mediators of`defense, for to launch an`offensive with such an army`of a mere five hundred`soldiers and priests would be`suicide and inevitably`guarantee Ardathium's`downfall. ``Grenic sent a message with`the pilgrims, who had to`travel through the Elddar`forest to reach safety as he`had instructed them to do so.`A small band of the`migrating pilgrims stopped at`one of the elven outposts on`the eastern border of the`forest. There, they left`Grenic's message, which`would reach Elwyean in the`halls of Takish'Hiz.`The great Koada'Dal wizard`was quick to follow`Grenic's request for his`guidance and wisdom,`for this several thousand`year-old elf was the`grand-sire of Viannay and had`given his blessing for`Ardathium's construction`outside of the sacred forest.``The news was nothing new to`Elwyean, for Ardathium's`impending doom had not`escaped the keen eyes of the`elves. Elwyean advised Grenic`that the destruction of the`swamp would diminish much`of the trolls' forces and`would leave them in`scattered chaos.`Grenic was hesitant,`though he did not take`Elwyean's advice lightly, for`an elf's pledge to destroy a`natural niche was not`something uttered in every`lifetime. The elves of the`Elddar believed that the`swamp was corrupt - that the`trolls' darkness had seeped`into every fiber of the land`and that even the trolls'`destruction would not uproot`the whole of the evil that`had infected the region. The`wizard informed Grenic that`the swamp would inevitably be`destroyed by the elves, but`it was up to Grenic to decide`whether or not this act would`be one in favor of his city's`continued existence, or one`executed after Ardathium's`fall.`	0
Ardathium5	After much consideration and`prayer, Grenic conceded to`Elwyean's advice and asked`for his aid, for the`swamplands were immune to`fires kindled by human hands.`The ancient, stoic elf`understood and advised`further that Grenic station`his troops for defensive`purposes, and to destroy the`trolls that dared to flee`toward the forest's borders. `Hesitantly, Grenic agreed,`knowing that the act would`undoubtedly leave a mark on`his soul for judgment in the`hereafter. However, his heart`and convictions were steely`upon his promise to the late`Countess and the protection`of the great city and`everything it stood for.``Elwyean briefly returned to`his people to inform them of`the coming destruction of the`swamp. The elves were on`guard for any trolls that`penetrated Grenic's forces,`though none left the Elddar`to directly aid the human`citadel. Elwyean's return`was heralded in a massive`azure, gold, and red`maelstrom of arcane fires`that erupted across the`swamplands. The magical fire`could be seen for miles`beyond the forest and its`glittering flames raged on`for days. Grenic's forces`destroyed hundreds of troll`warriors and civilians that`fled for their lives. ``After twelve long days, the`swamp of Innothule had been`obliterated - the waters`evaporated by the searing`heat of the blaze and even`the most robust of foliage`reduced to pillars of ash.`Elwyean never again returned`to Ardathium or consorted`with Grenic after the battle.`Grenic's fortress was safe,`though the cost of this`victory would weigh heavily`upon the knight's conscience`and soul for the next`several decades.``Summons were sent back to`the pilgrims that had`previously been sent away.`Most returned, though a few` opted to remain in the new`settlements that had begun`to establish upon the`eastern coast of the`continent. All were welcome`back, though Grenic denied a`celebration in the wake of a`time of mourning for what had`been done.`	0
Ardathium6	Years would pass and Grenic`would see the prosperity of`his city rise up from the`ashes of its former turmoil.`His remorse and shame`would lift their scars from` his soul and his thoughts`would change to that of`humble acceptance.`Grenic revered what he`had done as a necessity,`for if he had not`given into a tactic that`would otherwise be`dishonorable, all that he saw`before him-the peace and`happiness of his people, the`people of Marr-would have`fallen to damnation and ruin.``The next several decades`would bring prosperity and`peace to the people of`Ardathium. Grenic would`produce a son and daughter,`Erolysia and Mitharius, twin `children who would be`named after the patron`deity and his respected`sister that the fortress`had been founded for.`Upon Grenic's death,`Mitharius, a knighted warrior`in the Che Virtuson, would`ascend to Count of Ardathium.`The great leader's body`would be taken to the highest`tower in the city and in the`great chamber of Ardathium's`Heroes, Grenic's body would`be laid to final rest beside`his comrades.  ``Ardathium would experience`nearly a century of`prosperity and peace beneath`the leadership of Grenic's`bloodline, though a great`earthquake and the burning of`the Elddar forest would leave`the once-white and golden`jewel of Mithaniel's legacy`upon Norrath in irreparable`ruins that would, in the`passing eras, be consumed by`the desert sands of Ro. The`memory of this great city`would be lost as the ages`passed and turmoil wrought`the minds of the modern`cultures.``I hope that these words can`give resurrection to the`memory of this glorious`place - that the descendants`of its survivors and the`scholars of Marr will come`forward and restore the`proper glory and respect to`the memory of a mighty,`though compromised knight's`achievements and the history`of Marr's first successful`mortal campaign.`	0
ArmorTinker	Advanced Tinkering Manual``Greetings Gnomes!  I am `pleased to share with all of `you my research thus far on `upgrading Clockwork Watchman `armor into two sets of sturdy `armor more befitting of a `Gnome!  I first noticed that `the need for a set of `Chainmail was needed for the `Shadowwalkers, the assassins `of Ak'Anon.  To begin with I `needed a set of gears that `would replace the old ones, a `set that would never wear `down.  To make them I took a `normal gear and braced it `inside of my toolbox then `poured Celestial Temper onto `it.  For each gear I did this `to it would suddenly start to `glow and edges sharpen.``Next I would need some temper `to color the armor just the `right hue.  To make it `something to be proud of I `used Minotaur Blood as the `prime ingredient.  I then `added Firewater and Gnomish `Spirits.  After brewing these `three together I got a nice `metallic colored temper.``I then began to work on the `Shadowwalker armor!  Taking `the Clockwork Watchman armor I`placed it inside of a Small `Chainmail Pattern appropriate `to the armor piece.  I then `tinkered an imbued ruby or `imbued black sapphire into the`piece of armor.  All the while`also pouring on the metallic `temper and fitting the imbued `gears into place.  Here is a `list of the number gears `needed for each part:``Coif: Two gears.`Tunic: Three gears.`Sleeves: Three gears.`Bracelet: One gear.`Gloves: Two gears.`Pants: Three gears.`Boots: One gear.``After all that hard work a `full set of Clockwork `Shadowwalker Armor was `created!  Not only was it `reinforced with power but also`it kept the ability of the `original armor piece intact.  `Using a class five battery `will recharge it should the `power run out.``Finally I began to work on the`set of armor that I named `Clockwork Observer's Armor.  I`used all the same ingredients `that I did for the `Shadowwalker armor, but `substituted Small Plate Molds `were appropriate.	0

Blasphemere	The Blasphemer` Dag of the Forbidden Circle``  Long ago in the time of `Emperor Ganak, Scholar Dag`did walk with the great`Master Atrebe. ``  After the unfortunate`dusting of Atrebe did Dag`begin his study of the`forbidden circles, Wizardry,`Enchantment and Magic.  Very`soon after he took a liking`to the ways of Wizardry. `` His studies he kept to`himself as he ignored the`Laws of Kotiz. He became the`Blasphemer of the Brood.`Most of his studies were`held in private, only his`Sarnak slave named Kly was`allowed to assist in his `blasphemous studies. His`secret was soon to be `revealed to all.``  Dag was commissioned by `Kurn Machata to create a `magical dagger for his `personal use. It was to `only be wielded by one of`his ilk. Dag traveled to `Kurn's outpost to begin`his work. His slave went`along, pulling behind him`a special forge which `belonged to Haggle Baron`Dalnir.`  While Dag was away the`Brood stumbled upon his `journal and his secret `obsession. The Brood sent`word to Kurn to have Dag `deconstructed. ` Dag was in the final stage`of enchantments, Kurn let`him proceed and when the `dagger was complete, Kurn`shackled Dag and used the `dagger upon the belly the Blasphemer.` The dagger was found to`be very effective, but `lacked a few more spells`and so it was to be returned`to the Brood. It never made`it back. The Crusaders `sent, as well as the Sarnak`slave who was pulling the `Dalnir Forge, all vanished`without a trace. Only the`Dalnir Forge remained.` Surely the gods cursed the`blade made by the hands of`the Blasphemer.

Brodder1	Many Places I have traveled`many things I have seen, but`few things more than`treasures and heroic deeds`have moved me like a good`beverage has.`Each culture reveres it's`heroes, ridicule's it's`enemies, but always the`ale flows.`Many in Norrath proper say`Dwarves are the best brewers`as well as the best smiths,`one goes with the other.`It is hot work indeed, and a`crisp ale cuts the dust and`replenishes the soul where`minor pains and aches would`eventually force one to quit.`For a dwarf some say I'm`inquisitive as a Gnome, and`snooty as a High Elf when`it comes to tasting brews.`Perhaps I am, but By Brell`it's good to be a cleric`as the effects I've`suffered from my curiosity`have been painful at times.`I shall start in Faydwer`proper as it is close to my`kind.``STEAMFONT`My close companion Catbik`Tinkerton took me on the tour`of said lands.``Fizzlepop as noted in my other`journals has many purposes in`brewing, due to the amount of`sweetness it contains. I hear`that every 1 out of 6 can`cause an explosion when`bottled due to the intense`pressures contained inside.`Catbik once even made a Kobold`Pup balloon for scouting the`area by force feeding this`soda to the runt and tying a`rope to his legs. In the Pup's`tent I found the`following.``GRUPPA'S POPPIN' ALE`From the scrawling I assumed`it was an explosive device,`but instead it was a fiery`brew, Two bottles of FIZZLE`POP, would be left in the sun`to bake and become unstable,`two bottles of GNOMISH SPIRITS`would steep on a INFECTED RAT`LIVER in a bowl in open air,`PIXIE DUST would be used on`the second mix to clarify it.`Mix in a CASK the heated`sodas in the bottles, and the`clarified liverwater mix. The`Cask would be wrapped in a`rope to hold it together and`then throw at a rock or tree`so the bottles inside would`break. The Cask if intact`would be left to sit for a`week in the sun, then`decanted through a cloth`cap into bottles. It'd`result in four bottles`with a pleasant smell, horrid`taste, and a huge kick.	8
Brodder3	Other drinks I found in`Faydwer by talking to`merchants, travelers, and the`guards are as follows.``FAYDWER STINGER: Wasp stinger`cluster, bottle elven wine,`gnomish spirits, served in a`bottle, a red drink can be`seen as safe. If it is green`it's too poisonous to drink`and should be discarded.``FAYDWER SHAKER: Bottle Elven`wine, bottle gnomish spirits,`dwarven ale, bottle mead,`large cask. Mix shake in cask`serve in shot glasses. Make`enough for a full party of`friends. (makes six shots)``UNDERFOOT BROWN: Four ripe`underfoot mushrooms (as grown`in our farms in Kaladim),`bottle short Beer (starter),`water, malt, and a CASK.`Makes an Earthy brew loved by`dwarves and halflings.``Port- varied types, take 4`bottles of common wines and`distill them into a cask.`Known port types are:``GYPSY PORT- Four bottles`Gypsy Wine`RED PORT- four bottles of`Red Wine``FAYDWER PORT- Two bottles of`elven wine, a bottle of red`wine, and a bottle of white`wine.``RO PORT- Two bottles Red`Wine and two bottles Elven`Wine.``Use of an aged cask helps in`bringing out the best of`vintage. Halflings and elves`hold the secrets to making`aged oaken casks. Us Dwarves`reuse our casks as is only`proper, as aging this way`makes each generation of ale`and beer contribute to the`next.	8
Brodder4	The Drakes of Steamfont tend`to rest near some of the`hotter steamvents in that land.`There they shed their old`skins, on this grows a lichen`of properties unsurpassed in`all of Norrath.`Collecting this lichen, some`water and a clay pot I joked`that this would combine to`make a potable alcohol of`unusual flavors. It did`indeed, and to Catbik's`distaste proved much more`palatable than his favored`gnomish spirits, and nearly`as smooth as some of the aged`Vodkas I've tasted. To keep the Gnomes`happy I named this a Gnomish`Cleaning fluid recipe as it`resulted in two fluids. The`pot itself decanted and`filtered into a bottle`provided a small potable`beverage that I enjoyed, but`the remains in the pot`proved, once aged, that it'd`make a great stripper and`cleanser.`A LICHEN COVERED DRAKE SCALE,`found near steam vents,`cooking POT, WATER FLASK,`and a BOTTLE, result in`SUPERIOR LICHEN SPIRITS, and`a pot of cleaning paste.``The Minotaurs of Steamfront`had few ideas on brewing that`I discovered, but it's`rumored that a visiting`Minotaur Hero had a case of`huge bottles of a Malt heavy`brew, from our tort...um`questioning sessions, with`several slavers in the area`and compounded by my`knowledge of brewing, I've`determined that this MINOTAUR`HERO'S BREW was a heavy`malted liquor. I think I've`properly reproduced it,`though due to the varied`natures of waters, hops, and`malt around the lands its`quality can vary. Until I`find the proper recipe this`one shall bear its name.`Take thee three MALTS of`heavy quality, a single`YEAST, two measures of`WATER, and two SHORT BEERS`to start the reaction, into`a CASK of darken wood place`these and let steep. Decant`into bottles of Large size,`suited for heroes, cover this`bottle in brown parchment or`leather to keep the sunlight`off of it and provide`discretion for others will`want one themselves. I've`found large bottles produced`in Feerrott, by the ogre`glass blowers, and in Solusek`by the goblins there.	8
Brodder5	My experiences with Trolls`and Ogres.``Ogre swill and other swamp`inspired beverages aren't the`only thing to come from these`beasts. Some of them have a`gift for brewing. They joke,`I hope it's a joke, that it`came from eating a dwarven`brewer at one time or another``First off is BOOT BEER,`strange indeed as it sounds.`The foul brew requires a`Large Leather Boot, swamp`vegetables, swamp mushrooms,`malt, a water flask, and Milk``The solids are bundled in a`lil cloth bag and stuffed at`the bottom of the boot. A`troll wears the boot for a`few days and then adds the`malt water and milk. It sits`on a shelf till remembered,`or until it foams enough that`someone notices it. This`beverage is as disgusting as`it sounds, and floored me for`over a day and a half,`luckily the troll teaching me`the secrets was unconscious`just a bit longer, I copied`the notes and stole away.``I left him this gift, written`in runes and pictures so he`might understand it easier`as a fair trade:``SKUNK BREATH ALE`2 skunk glands, gnomish`spirits, short beer, malt,`yeast, water, cask.`From the sudden trade in`skunk glands to South Ro from`butcher block one must assume`that this is a hit with the`Trolls of Innothule, I hear`Innothule's Breath is what`they named the beverage. I`hear the smell stays on your`breath for days after you`drink it, a probable source`of amusement for the trolls.	8
Brodder6	Ogres- I've managed to`befriend some of the ogres,`by playing off the politics`that run between the shaman`cultures and their`shadowknights. here I tried`such things as ARMADILLO`SIMMER ALE, and TAIL KICKER.`As best I can remember the`first is made with Armadillo`fat, while the husk is made`into a serving bowl, the fat`is rendered and mixed with`ogre swill, which clears it`up considerably, mixed with`vinegar, malt, and yeast.`Surprisingly it was a`passable beverage, with a`surprising kick. Which leads`me to think that an alchemist`imprisoned here developed`this drink to buy his freedom`and to make living here while`waiting for freedom bearable.`The TAIL KICKER is made by`boiling lizard tails in`vinegar, adding malt, yeast`and two flasks of water. The`results are distilled into`clay flasks, trust me one`flask of this juice is enough`to uncurl a Dwarf's beard and`untie his boots.`I asked about the fabled`Burning SKULL ALE, and was`told that it was made for big`ceremonies and required a`sacrifice of not a few`prisoners. Their skulls were`cut open at the top and the`brains removed and mixed with`rare herbs and vinegar`(what's with ogres and`vinegar?), and spices and`short beer. It was set near`a fire and ready when the`skull's began to burn with an`internal flame. Alchemy or`brewing I'm not sure, but I`did steal a nicely carved`Cyclops skull.`My host wondered why no one`made that drink anymore, my`last words in Oggok were`"maybe it's that brains are`just in short supply in`Oggok" I left in a hurry`before they figured that one`out.	8

CeteltVol1	The Great Wall of Cetelt `As told by Dremond the `skulker;`And Rollies, a lady in waiting`Penned by Grenated.``[A note to the reader: I have `endeavored to bring this tale `to you exactly as it was told `to me. Some parts are vague`on the circumstance of the`speakers that I was quoting.`Other parts were omitted as `they bear little on the `history at hand.]``"See, I lived 'round these `parts then. I was something of`a local hero. Or maybe, `celebrity is a better way o' `putting it. All right, I was a`well-known drunk. But that `don't change a thing of what I`saw in them days; I never got `so stiff that I blacked out, `it was always just enough to `put the edge off a bit, `understand?"``"Anyhow, Cetelt was one o' `them big time adventurer `types; always slaying orcs and`gnolls and lootin' em. Always `tellin' his own tales bigger `than they really was. Now `don't get the wrong whiff `here; he was a good fighter. `He could skin a kobold with `one hand and parry the attacks`o' three orcs with the other, `all the while talkin' about `how well he was doin' it. But `truth be told, he wasn't one `of the greats; not enough `ambition. He never wanted to `be a prince or king or called `'highness or majestic like' or`any o' those noble style `things. He just wanted to `adventure. At least that's how`it was until his sixtieth `year."``[At this point Dremond seemed`to grow a bit melancholy and `began to mumble about`Cetelt's early exploits and`how the later years had`caught up to him.`I could not hear these `words well and ask the pardon`of the reader in the matter of`this part of the record being `unclear. I bought Dremond `another flagon and probed him`with this question: What `happened in his sixtieth `year?]``"Whose? Oh, Cetelt. Well, it `was in that year that his `father died, only a few months`after his aunt that had raised`him. He didn't seem right `after that. He started calling`for seers and sooths and `whatnot to come to him. This `was when he took up shop in `The Misty Thicket, see? I `dunno why he decide to live `with these halfies, I never `cared for 'em too much, but `hey, who am I to call a thief `a thief?"``"Anyways, you gotta 'member `that Cetelt had built up a `pretty good following of other`adventurers by this time. Now,`Cetty (that's wot we called `him behind his back), Cetty `didn't have no aspirations of `kinghood or nothin', but his `followers thought of him as `such and they would do any `thing he asked. They kept `beggin' him to take over this `land and conquer that. Well, `finally he snapped." ``"He said, and I remember this `well; he said, 'If you fools `want to build something, build`me a castle on Cair Leima.'  `See, that's the little hill `just out of Rivervale."	9
CeteltVol2	"Of course, Cetelt knew it was`too steep for any kind of `foundation, but his boys and `girls they were fanatic like `and tried anyway. Three times `they tried to build there only`to see the whole thing `crumble."``"Cetty said that the only `thing a castle would get him `would be some young punk `looking for a siege. That `reminds me of a joke: There `was this young girl who's `father tried to protect her `chastity." [I have omitted `this rather vulgar anecdote to`speed up this narrative.]``"Sooooo, after about a year `Cetelt snaps, like I said, and`calls all o' his people around`him and sez, ' You all wanna `do something? Then build a `wall. A wall betwixt these `fine people, (meanin' the `halfies) and the foul breath `of doom that constantly `threatens them.'  [I think he `meant the goblins of Runny `Eye.]``"So his punks, feverish with `love for the old boy, went a `working. None too fast now. `You gotta 'member, these were`adventurers [said with a `sneer], not real workers like `you and me. So, by the by it `takes 'em fifteen years to `finish this one little wall. `Lazy bastards. Why, in my day `I coulda shown any one of 'em `how the world really works. `Not a one of 'em knew their `arse end from..." [Another `tedious monologue deleted. I `bought more grog for Dremond]``"Well, thash it really. As `shoon as the wall was done, `Cetty took a big long `looky-poo and marched`through the gatesh.`He said., 'Hold these gatesh`for my return.' `He shouted a few curses and `was gone. Then he headed`into Runny eye and hashn't`bin sheen shinze`..ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz."``[At this point the Halfling `woman that was serving us, `Rollies, was kind enough to `recount her version of the `events]``"Oh, yes, I remember when `Cetelt came here and decided `to retire. He could not seem `to be rid of his hangers-on. `They begged to do some task `for him and he obliged them by`asking that they build a fort `on Cair Leima. I'm quite sure `that Cetelt, having taken `quite a shine to us wee folk, `was intent on giving this land`some protection from the `goblins that roamed `incessantly here. But Cetelt's`people were not architects, `alas. They never could get the`foundation for the fort right `and it tumbled down, again`and again."``"Finally, Cetelt ordered that `a wall be built across the `breadth of the woods. He had `it built tall and strong and `cleared the trees on the bad `side so that the goblins could`be seen coming from quite a `ways."``"Strangely enough though, as `soon as the wall was finished `he shut himself on the bad `side and with a shout of,  'I `will be rid of this curse!' `disappeared. It didn't take `long for his people to weary `of waiting for him and to `trickle out of these parts; `looking for other adventures, `I would wager."``"Now the wall stands mostly `undefended and the gates are `rotted off. Some still stand `the vigil, but most halflings `have little to do with them. `There are more merry pursuits `here on the edge of `Rivervale."``[Rollies left me then and I `left Dremond to his cups.  The`wall has since come to be `known by the denizens of `Rivervale as the Great Wall of`Serilis, for one of their `gods, though there are many `who remember how it came to `be, and who sometimes call it `by this name.]`	9

There is some force moving around me that I cannot identify.  I fear that this presence will make itself known soon.  I must assume at this time that Korucust is working to expose me.

Although Emperor`Sathir ruled from the Kunzar`city of Sebilis, he was `rumored to have stored his`most valuable possessions`within the library of `Charasis. ``` Emperor Sathir's beloved,`Drusella, rests within a `grand crypt in Charasis' `depths. After her funeral`and burial, Emperor Sathir`cast all citizens from the`cliff city. Only the royal`guard and servants where `allowed to stay, forever.`These Iksar were never again`to feel the warmth of the `sun or bask in the moonlight.`It is written that Emperor`Sathir crafted a spell to `hide the entrance of `Charasis from raiders and`those who dared to steal his`knowledge and defile his`beloved Drusella's crypt.`Emperor Sathir would visit`the cliff city frequently.`What he would do inside is`not known. ``Upon the death of one of`Emperor Sathir's royal guard`was revealed the secret to`gaining entry into Charasis.`Upon a tattered scroll did `the guard record the secret.`The scroll is now lost to `the world. Taken as pure`babble by the mortician, it`was cast aside and lost to`time.``After Emperor Sathir's death`his son and new emperor, `Rile, was the last to hold the`secret of entry. The ancient`cult of Emperor Sathir known`as the Arisen are rumored to`have acquired the lost scroll`of the royal guard. They are`said to care for the crypt`of the late Emperor Sathir.```It was during the time known`as the End Days that the `spirits of Tunare, Underfoot`and the Rainkeeper destroyed`most of the great cities`of the ancients. Charasis`and its guardians and `treasures are lost forever.`May those entombed within`guard her secrets from `invaders.	18

ColHis1	` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume I: Lost at Sea``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  During the ancient days when`the first city of the dwarves `was under construction, `dwarves were being sent across`the lands and sea to find `precious reserves of stone, `crystal, and ore for the `project. Ships sailed in and `out by the dozens bringing `supplies for the great `project. One fleet of such `ships was sailing across the `South of Antonica to reach the`unknown island that would `eventually be Odus, where a `quartz mine was being set up `in the name of the dwarves. `Led by the miner and explorer `Colin Dain, the fleet of a `dozen ships carrying about 200`dwarves ran into one of the `worst storms Prexus had ever `unleashed. Tossed and turned, `flipped and torn the storm `raged on for days as most of `the dwarves huddled together `in the ships' holds waiting `for the seas to calm. When `finally after eight days of `turbulence the gales subsided `and the dwarves crawled onto `their tattered decks they `found that six of their ships `had been lost to the storm `along with their crews and `passengers. Worst of all not `even the best of the remaining`navigators or cartographers `had a clue as to where they `were. Even the stars in the `sky could not be relied upon `for navigation, as none of `them were recognizable to the `dwarves who had never been in `this region before.	0
ColHis2	` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume II: A New World``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  Using typical dwarven logic,`Colin picked a direction to `sail in and decided that their`only hope was to keep sailing `in that direction until they `spotted land. As the days and `then weeks went by the only `noticeable difference to the `dwarves was that things began `to get a lot colder. Some `nights were so cold that many `a dwarf froze to death on the `decks, turned into a guardian`statue of ice by the cruel `weather. Only the morale `boosting and determination of `Colin Dain kept the dwarves'`hopes alive as he popped from `ship to ship assuring the `dwarves that they would "Hit `land soon, if'n not tommorow `then the day after." `Eventually Colin's words rang `true as the dwarves did indeed`spot a gigantic white landmass`in the distance. Unfortunately`the landing proved to be as `deadly as the voyage there as `a reef of icebergs both small `and large begin to tear the `small fleet apart. Not a `single ship made it to what `could only be thought of as a `giant glacier intact. Most `were torn apart far from the `land, and many of the `remaining dwarves met with icy`deaths in the heart of the `ocean. All in all ninety-four `of the two hundred some `dwarves who left from the `Northern Hemisphere countless `days before made it onto that `icy beach. Not a single ship `was serviceable. `  Colin Dain wasted no time in`leading his people from the `shoreline. He knew that  they `would have to find shelter to `keep from dying in the cold. `He also knew that they would `need to find wood and other `supplies so they could repair `the remaining ships and  set `off for fairer lands. And so `the quartz miners from the `north settled in a nest of `abandoned caves found about `ten miles inland from where `they landed, in the side of a `giant mountain of ice and snow`in the northernmost tip of the`Great Divide.	0
ColHis3	` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume III: Froststone Keep``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``There's an old Erudite saying `that states, "Dwarves are like`time itself, neither can ever `remain idle." This certainly `proved true for the new `settlement. The miners quickly`discovered that the hard-`packed ice lying beneath the `snow of Velious was as durable`and malleable as stone. Being `mostly quartz miners, the `dwarves found they liked this `ice just fine and were `building all sorts of things `with it in no time. The great `walruses found along the coast`proved to be an invaluable `source of food and furs, `although many a warrior fell `to the beasts thinking `"they're just dumb animals." `It was for this reason and `others that a small dwarven `settlement was formed near the`shores of the ocean in the `Eastern Wastes. Through time `the settlement became a town, `and then a strong dwarven keep`seemed to form as if a new `mountain had been born. Named `Froststone, for the ice it was`built from, the dwarves `realized that with the `completion of this keep their `stay on this strange new land `was permanent. `Unfortunately this time of `peace for the dwarves was `coming to an end as they ran `into the first other `intelligent life on Velious, `the frost giants.	0
ColHis4	` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume IV: Our Greatest Loss``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  The frost giants make up the`largest population in the `Eastern Wastes and consider `those lands their home. `Needless to say they did not `take kindly to the children of`Brell building a fortress `along their northeastern `border. And so it was with `great surprise that the `dwarves woke up one day to `find their home under siege by`an army of giants. After days `of vicious battle the dwarves `realized that they could not `possibly hold out against the `giants. Colin Dain led the `exile from their new home in `the Great Divide to the only `place they could go - deeper `into the mountains. The ice `giants followed them into the `mountains and a small group of`dwarves volunteered to stay `behind while the others `escaped. Colin Dain himself `led the suicide ambush, buying`his people enough time to `escape the giants' reach. From`this time onward the dwarves `vowed to refer to themselves `as the Coldain in honor of `their beloved leader, and also`that all the leaders of their `people would carry the title `Dain. From this day forward `the Coldain were a new people `born from the roots of dwarven`kind. This event also `established an enemy of the `Coldain that will most likely `remain until the end of time.`  As for Froststone Keep `itself, all that remains are `ruins in the Eastern Wastes `marking the remnants of a once`great citadel.	0
ColHis5	` Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume V: The Crystal Caverns``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  While hiding out in the `frigid caverns, a Coldain `miner by the name of Glight `Snowchipper received a vision `from Brell. The vision was of `a labyrinth of ice where the `dwarves could hide from the `ice giants. These caverns `would be a twisting maze so `that the invading giants would`become easily lost and fall `into the many deathtraps the `dwarves would set up. These `caverns of crystal would be `the salvation of the Coldain `race. ``  And so Glight presented his `idea to Dain Frostreaver the `First, son of Colin Dain and `called Frostreaver for his `efficiency in dispatching `giants, and construction `began. The Crystal Caverns `were completed in a little `under half a century. The `timeliness of the project `alone was proof to the Coldain`that Glight had indeed been `inspired by Brell. The true `test of the caverns' `effectiveness came 30 years `later when the Kromrif `discovered the location of the`Crystal Caverns. Slagd `Frozentoe of the Kromrif led `an invasion force of two `hundred and fifty warriors to `the cavern, hoping to wipe the`hated Coldain from Velious `once and for all. Glight `Snowchipper himself led the `defense of the Coldain leading`the ice giants deep into the `confusing caverns. His magical`pickaxe, aptly named `Snowchipper, split many a `giant's kneecap as the dwarves`struck repeatedly from hidden `passages and around dimly `lit corners. Despite losing `more than two thirds of his `forces, Slagd and the `remaining giants had almost `made it to the Coldain city in`the center of the caverns when`Glight pulled off his greatest`and final trick. Thirty `thousand tons of ice and stone`crashed into Slagd and his `remaining giants after Glight `and a few of his brave miners `led them down a false passage.`Unfortunately it was an act of`self-sacrifice as the dwarf `and his fellows were also `buried in the intentional `avalanche.	0
ColHis6	`Coldain Heritage and History:`Volume VI: The Second Exodus``Inscribed by: `Grand Historian Nicmar``  Over the centuries that `followed, strange creatures `began migrating into the `Crystal Caverns. These `monsters were a collection of `the most deadly cave dwellers `who inhabited the frosty caves`of Velious. Unfortunately for `the Coldain, these monsters `used stealth and camouflage to` hunt their prey. The crystal `widows are a breed of `arachnids that are almost `entirely translucent and `blend in with the walls of the`crystal caverns catching many `an unwary miner with their `poison glass fangs. `Stalagterrors are particularly`nasty hunter which `appears to be an ordinary ice `stalactite, launching their `frosty tentacles and opening `their icy maws only when their`prey is within reach. It was `these foes and more which `eventually caused the dwarves `to abandon the Crystal Caverns`and set out to build a new `fortress more akin to Frost-`keep. There are rumors that a `few dwarves refused to leave `their home in the center of `the Caverns but what has be-`come of them is unknown.	0

ConiumNote01	Conium's Notebook One``Nubs Came to Visit.`My old friend Nubs returned`from his journey to the Lava-`storm Mountains, his hands`still stained red with the`blood of the goblins native`to those lands. Among his bag`of trophies I found a strange`black fungus. Nubs calls it a`DEATH CAP due to a white`vaguely skull-shaped marking`adorning the cap. Nubs tells`me they are grown by kobolds`who live in the volcano of`Solusek's Eye, and that two,`combined with BLACK HENBANE,`also grown by the kobolds,`create a poison that numbs a`person's mind so that they are`oblivious to actions around`them. Be sure to have a SEALED`POISON VIAL and LARENT`SUSPENSION for storage. Heh,`Nubs says the kobold shamans`ingest it themselves in prayer`to their god.```A Really Angry Goblin.`I had just returned from the`Lesser Faydarks where I had`gone to collect some PIXIE`DUST so that I may experiment`with the rumor that the dust`can sometimes drive a person`crazy. Upon opening my pack I`discovered that the dust had`spilt and now coated the`AMANITA PHALLOIDE fungi I had`collected from the rotten`mulch that passes for a lawn`in the Estate of Unrest.`Thinking my pixie dust wasted`I went ahead and prepared the`fungi in the usual manner`with a SEALED POISON VIAL and`LARENT SUSPENSION and set out`to hunt goblins. I found me a`goblin all right and boy was`I surprised when the fungi`poison I had coated my blades`with made him go berserk.`I've never seen a goblin`fight so desperately in all my`years slaying the vermin.`Fortunately the ugly critter`dropped dead within minutes`of the poison taking effect.	5
ConiumNote02	Conium's Notebook Two``Thank Brell for Mater``On my last visit to my home,`Kaladim, I paid a visit to`my old mentor, Mater. He has`just documented some studies`he did on toxicology of ores`and granted me the honor of`giving me a copy of`his work.``With the information provided`by Mater, and the ever-present`aqua goblins here in Dagnor's`Cauldron to test them on, I`have developed some effective`metal-based poisons. My first`experiment was a mixture of`LEAD PEROXIDE, WHITE LEAD and`QUICKSILVER with a SEALED`POISON VIAL and LARENT`SUSPENSION. I was sure to heed`Mater's warnings and take`extreme care when applying it`to my blade. The outcome was`much to my liking. The goblin`doubled over clutching his`head and midsection with his`slimy hands.``My second mixture consists of`one part IRON SULPHIDE and`two parts QUICKSILVER with a`SEALED POISON VIAL and LARENT`SUSPENSION. This mixture`although a bit more difficult`to mix properly and apply was`even more effective than the`first had been. This one`causes the goblins not only`to double over from the pain`but fall down completely,`writhing on the rocky cliffs.`My only regret is that death`is rather swift so the vile`critters don't suffer as much`as they would with a weaker`mixture.	5
craftytailor1	THE CRAFTY TAILOR``            by`        Meeka Diggs``Every summer in the vale we`must face the insect season`when the little buggers come`in swarms to feast on our`crops and march on our homes.`This past summer my hubby`returned home from a daily`wander with a captured`spiderling. I was at first`appalled by the creature but`my hubby placed it in a large`wooden cage outside our home`so that the insects could fly`in and get caught in the webs`and the spiderling could not`get out.`Each day the spider would`tear down his web and discard`the silk and soon I had a`large amount of the material`to dispose of.`As I reached for my broom one`day I stumbled and scraped my`palms in the fall. I hurried`to our cupboard for a bandage`and to my dismay there were`none in our home.`That was when Bristlebane`blessed me with a bit of his`craftiness. Taking my trusty`TAILORING KIT, I wove a spool`of SILK THREAD from TWO bits`of SPIDERLING SILK. Once I`had TWO spools of SILK THREAD`I wove a SILK BANDAGE and`bound my injured palms.`With so much silk at my`disposal I quickly ran out of`bags to store it in. Taking`THREE spools of SILK THREAD I`wove a SILK CORD and then`made myself a SMALL BAG from`the SILK CORD and a LOW`QUALITY WOLF SKIN.`In order to prevent myself`from falling and injuring`myself on the hard floors I`used my remaining LOW QUALITY`SKIN of wolves, cats, and`bears and one SILK THREAD to`fashion some LEATHER PADDING`which I laid on the floors.

In order to craft such an Idol one will have to acquire an Idol Sketch, a Large Block of Magic Clay, a Vial of Clear Mana, Sculpting Tools, and an Imbued Gem of the appropriate Deity. Once the Idol is sculpted on the Pottery Wheel it must be glazed and fired in a Kiln. This process will require a High Quality Firing Sheet , the Unfired Idol, and Divine Crystalline Glaze.

DERobe1	House of Spurned Tailoring `Theory I``The House of the Spurned `has offered me the chance `to prove my ability in the `fields of Arcane.  Because `we Dark Elves are `proficient in each of the `four fields I have made `robes based on each.  First`I have drawn upon the power`of the lands that we `occupy, and created a dye `from this power.  This will`intensify the potency of `the robes:``Cursed Dye: Cursed Clover `of Viesar, Flask of Water``Ashen Dye: Ashweed, Flask `of Water``Next I apply the power of `the lands to the ribbons `that will be used to tie `the vestments together.  `Shears are essential due `the ribbons being woven `from metal threads:``Silvery Grey Ribbon: Cursed`Dye, Silver Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Silvery Black Ribbon: Ashen`Dye, Silver Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Golden Grey Ribbon: Cursed `Dye, Gold Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Golden Black Ribbon: Ashen `Dye, Gold Ribbon, and Elm `Handled Shears``Platinum Grey Ribbon: `Cursed Dye, Platinum `Ribbon, and Elm Handled `Shears``Platinum Black Ribbon: `Ashen Dye, Platinum Ribbon,`and Elm Handled Shears``Studying each realm of `arcane, I have become quite`proficient.  Drawing upon `that knowledge I have `decided to copy down the `component of some of the `more powerful spells.  `Using a quill and piece of `parchment I have made the `following swatches:``Cyclone Runed Swatch: Rune `of Cyclone``Burnish Scried Swatch: `Words of Burnishing``Wing Etched Swatch: Wing of`Xegony``Ellipse Runed Swatch: Rune `of Ellipse``Argli Scribed Swatch: Page `73 Yaeth's Compendium `(Right Side)``Abrogation Scried Swatch: `Words of Abrogation	4
DERobe2	House of Spurned Tailoring `Theory II``Next a special needle is `needed that will not draw `power from the ribbons `being sewn into the robes. `Because it has the essence `of our lands added to it, `the power of the ribbon `remains intact:``Tier'Dal Needle: `Embroidering Needle, `Nektulos Essence``Now that the basic elements`have been created the robes`can be tailored.  Using the`Tier'Dal Needle, and Dark `Robe Pattern the following `robes can be created:``Robe of the Cyclone: `Cyclone Runed Swatch, `Silvery Grey Ribbon``Robe of Burnishing: Burnish`Scried Swatch, Silvery `Black Ribbon``Robe of Wings: Wing Etched `Swatch, Golden Grey Ribbon``Robe of Ellipse: Ellipse `Runed Swatch, Golden Black `Ribbon``Robe of Argli: Argli `Scribed Swatch, Platinum `Grey Ribbon``Robe of Abrogation: `Abrogation Scried Swatch, `Platinum Black Ribbon`	4

It's time`you learned to control your`gossip.``The family secret "Dough" is`made from a Cup of Flour, a`snake egg, and a bottle of`milk.

discord	``"I do this not out of a`Sense of charity or`compassion, but because it`is what has been ordained`that I must do.  I write`because as a Child of Order,`you must know."``-  The Seventh Hammer``Across the face of Norrath`and into the Age of Turmoil`were born the Children of`Order.  A force known`as "Order" has made itself`manifest.  These chosen few`have been set apart from the`rest of the creatures of`Norrath. While they can`recognize another of`their kind, regardless of`race, they seem oblivious`of their gift. They swear`loyalty to or disavow the`known gods.  They murder,`steal, love and champion the`causes of the Unchosen,`those who were not born of`Order.  But to each other`they are always civil for`each Child of Order is`under the "protection" of`this benevolent power.`While tempers may flare,`they seem unable to harm each`other except by mutual`consent. While it seems that`such "protection" would be a`boon, as with anything freely`given, this gift is not`appreciated until it is gone.`Agents of another being`known only as "Discord" have`arisen.  These Priests of`Discord seek to disrupt the`mysterious experiment of`Order.  They teach that true`power can only be gained by`embracing Discord.  Some are`listening to these seductive`words.  By rejecting Order,`they have lost their`protection and prey upon each`other with ruthless abandon.`It seems that Order can`never be expunged from them`completely. Even those who`have embraced Discord can`only harm those who have also`abandoned Order and are of`nearly equal power.  Beware`Child.  Once you have`embraced Discord you will be`in constant peril and you`will never again be protected`by Order.``My duty is complete and you`are now faced with a choice.`Remain in the embrace of`Order or join the forces of`Discord.  If you choose to`remain in the protection of`Order, you need do nothing`and I recommend that you`destroy this tome at once.`But, if you seek the way of`Discord, seek out a Priest`of Discord and offer him`this book.  With that act`your fate will be sealed.	0

But`that screeching loud mouth`Eeporp let the cat out of the`bag. You'd think with that`throat injury he received back`in the war he'd speak more`quietly but instead, we are`all subjected to his incessant`appalling screech!``So now RokGus's supporters`have fled to the mines and we`are at war. I've completed the`elevator and we should be able`to raid Nurga more easily. If`we can gain the favor of the`outsiders and turn them to our`side, we may finally be able`to end all traces of our`internal enemies and focus our`attentions outward.``I wish I didn't have to deal`with morons. That cursed`cleric Lerkuk and his almost`incomprehensible alliterative`speaking drives me crazy. He`never should have made that`enchanter angry. And then`there is Blerk our top`"knight", whose ego is only`overshadowed by his extreme`state of constant`hyperactivity. Glugug has been`hit in the head too many times`make much sense. At least`he is a strong and loyal`toady.``Dagglit is a good lad. He is`young but he has potential.`If something should ever need`to happen to Zuqbert, I'd want`him on my side. I gave him`RokGus's eye as a souvenir`to garner his favor.``Durblik isn't too bad.`He has some sense and is`quite an accomplished wizard.`He claims to have found a way`to both entice outsiders to`help us in our fight as well`as to keep them coming back. I`respect his intelligence.``I also have a lot of respect`for Sugbuk. As our primary spy`in Nurga, his intelligence is`proving invaluable to us.

DTDpg74	Oct 2`Today was an especially cold`day.  Never stay in Halas`again.  The only bright`point was I met a Master`Brewer named Garsen who`agreed to join our group and`help us explore the uncharted`depths of Permafrost.  He`seems to speak only in rhyme`which is a bit annoying but`his skill with weapons makes`up for it.  He said he has to`keep practicing because he is`writing countless books of`Brewing Limericks.``Oct 3`Everfrost Mountains must be`the coldest place on Norrath,`and to make matters worse we`were almost killed by a`Mammoth that appeared over`a peak.  Tolan was almost`slain but Garsen saved him.``Oct 4`We discovered underground`caverns.  The only thing`more frightening than`monsters is Garsen opening`his mouth.  I'd say, " I need`to sit and rest".  He'd`follow with; "Do you really`think that's best?"  Tolan`said, "We could really use a`Cleric".  Garsen replied,`"Don't be a hysteric".  I`can't take it, can't take it.	-1
DTDpg75	Oct 5`Garsen was quite offended by`Tolan's outburst today.`Tolan said that our food`tasted like it came from the`sewer and Garsen, as usual,`replied with a rhyme, "It`could taste better with a`skewer."  Tolan made him`realize how irritating his`voice is.  One more rhyme,`ONE more damn rhyme, and`I'll kill him myself.``Oct 6`Garsen was quiet all day`today and didn't mutter a`word even when he was almost`killed and needed help.``However, when we stopped to`camp we had to sleep right`next to each other because of`our location.  Garsen was`murmuring rhymes in his`sleep.  Every damn word out`of his mouth rang in my ears.`Each syllable lingered just`long enough to drive me`crazy.  I kept praying that`the next word would not`rhyme.  Satisfaction never`came.``Tolan and I talked and de-`cided to help him sleep a bit`better.``Oct 7`We rifled through our de-`parted friends things and`found the unfinished`limericks and component`charts on the brewing trade.`After destroying many Tolan`suggested someone might want`to buy the rest.  We'll try`to sell them in Halas.	-1
DTDpg76	Oct 23`Just got out of prison and`finally received my possess-`ions back.  I arrived back`in Halas on the 9th and sold`the limericks to a Barbarian`who paid a hefty amount of`silver for the work.  As I`was walking down the street`a Blacksmith said, "I'll`have to charge my usual fee`of 12 copper."  His patron`replied, "If I pay you that`much I'll be a pauper."  I`had no idea if the rhyme was`intentional or not but un-`controllable rage swept over`me.  Slowly, ever so slowly,`I turned, grabbed the patron`by the throat and squeezed.`It took six guards to free`him.  One guard gave me a`strong warning and said,`"You must now leave our`city".  Which was fine but`another guard said right`afterward, "Do this again`and face the committee."`Before I could realize it,`my hands were wrapped around`the guard's throat. Jail`wasn't that bad save the`rats, bats, mildew, and`stench.  Unusually, the jail`served rat sandwiches`everyday. At least no one has`said a rhyme to me since.`The end to the horror seems`far from sight. Rhyming`winter nightmares have sadly`impaled me. Writhing with`nightly havoc, sanity eludes`me.	-1

ErudJourn1	Journal Excerpt One``The company with which I `travel has reached the `settlement of Freeport, little`more than a collection of `tents and wooden huts` guarded by ruffians and`crawling with brigands and`men of a most scrupulous`nature. Despite the filth`and seediness of the`settlement, I must admit there`are wonders to be found here `unlike any I have laid eyes on`in all of Antonica. Tradesman `peddle these strange wares `gathered from across the`Ocean of Tears on a`continent said to be filled`with lush forests and`strange humanoids, some of`which are fairly hospitable to`visiting foreigners. I can`only assume that we humans`are as strange to them as`they are to us.`My companions and I`will attempt to charter `passage on one of the trading `vessels as soon as we have `secured the necessary `provisions for the journey.``Journal Excerpt Two``Never have I dreamt of a body `of water so vast as the Ocean `of Tears, although my home `city of Qeynos rests against `the western coast of Antonica `I have never voyaged upon a `ship for such great distances `and so far from any visible `coastline. The traders that we`have purchased passage`from recount tales of`several Islands that have`been visible in the distance`through the ocean mist`and fog. They spoke of an`island of elven women that `slay any man who sets foot on `their sacred shores, of `goblins that live in the `shallows and underwater `caverns, and of one-eyed `giants that hunt sharks like `our fishermen hunt fish. There`are even tales of lost ships `that haunt the ocean, manned `by crews of the dead. How`much truth there is to any`of the tales is questionable`but if anything, they make`for entertaining stories to`pass the time at sea.``Journal Excerpt Three``The ship that carries my `companions and I has docked`on the shore of a region`called the Butcherblock`Mountains. Apparently this`is the homeland of the`Dwarves, a race of short,`stocky, gruff, and hairy`people with a fondness`for battle and beer.`I'm afraid I have not much in `common with these dwarven`folk but the warriors of my`company seem to have`taken a liking to them.`There are none among us`who speak their language but`a few of the dwarves that`reside near the docks have`learned enough of our`human tongue to answer`basic questions we have`presented to them, and`beneath their gruff and`rugged mannerisms they`seem to possess a great`deal of `patience.`	2
ErudJourn2	Journal Excerpt Four``The dwarves have been kind `enough to invite us to their `home city of Kaladim, a rather`stuffy and cramped `subterranean city built into `one of the taller mountains of`the Butcherblock range. The `most impressive sight so far `has been the enormous statue`that has been carved into the `very side of the mountain. `Apparently it is the visage of`a great dwarven king. Some of `our company has taken a liking`to the strong brews of the `Dwarves. I fear it may be time`to move on before their minds `get dulled by the intoxicating`substances, and the `oppressiveness of being `constantly surrounded by`stone and the clatter of the`mines echoing through out`the caverns is wearing on my`sanity.``Journal Excerpt Five``My company has left the `dwarven capitol of Kaladim`and now journeys into the`deep forests of the Faydark,`home of the elves.`We have had the fortune`of hiring a scout and `translator for our journey `into the lands of the elves. `It seems this odd individual, `Tolsarian, is a Half-Elf, I `had heard of the union`between an elf and human`but have never before`actually had the`opportunity to meet one. I`found Tolsarian to be a very `intelligent individual and he `possessed a vast knowledge`of the Faydarks and its many`inhabitants. Tolsarian spoke `little however of his `heritage, he spoke of the `humans and elves as if neither`were his people, and I sensed `a deep sadness in his `demeanor. Tolsarians spirits `did seem to lift a bit when we`reached the tree city of the `wood elves, the Fier'Dal I `believe it was that Tolsarian `called them, and were greeted `by an elven maiden that `appeared before us as if she `had stepped forth from the `very bark of the tree before `us.``Journal Excerpt Six``I've found my stay in the tree`city of Kelethin much more `pleasing than my stay in the `stifling halls of Kaladim. `Some of my company do not `agree with my pleasure, they `find the wine of the elves to `be far less enjoyable than the`rich brews of the dwarves.`These drunkards in my`company have such simple`minds to base so much of`their enjoyment off the`imbibing of intoxicating`beverages. These Fier'Dal are`a strange people, even `stranger to me than the`dwarves. The dwarves are`blunt of speech and manner`and their simple ways are`easy for even the weakest`minded of my companions`to understand. The Fier'Dal` however are puzzling.`I have no doubt that they are `an intelligent people but they`are uninterested in`scholastics and conventional `knowledge. Instead these aptly`named Wood Elves are`frivolous and mysterious,`spending all their time`sneaking about the forests,`caring for its wild beasts,`and singing and dancing`in their tree top city.`Their history and lore `seems to be told mostly in `folklore and poetry, though `they have a written language, `which according to Tolsarian, `is shared with their relatives`the High Elves. They are `however, a good people, and `there is wisdom in their `poetry and song.`	2
ErudJourn3	Journal Excerpt Seven``Our friend Tolsarian has led `us from Kelethin deeper into `the Faydark to the High Elf, `or Koada'Dal as they are `called in their own tongue, `city of Felwithe. I must say `compared to the tree city of `Kelethin, Felwithe is indeed a`splendid sight to behold. It's`white walls and palaces `soaring high above the canopy `of the forest. I am surprised `to find that the Koada'Dal are`much taller than their `Fier'Dal relatives, their `complexion is much paler and `their hair and eyes the colors`of the stars and skies instead`of the earth and trees. We `received a far less hospitable`welcome to the city of the `High Elves than we had `received in Kelethin. The`guards at the cities gate`questioned Tolsarian for quite`some time and looked over`each member of my company`thoroughly before admitting us`within the outer walls. Once `inside the city proper it`became apparent that while`the Feir'Dal are wise, the`Koada'Dal are the intelligent`branch of the elven family. I `have beheld wonders in this `city beyond any I have `imagined. In the northern `quarter of the city is a tower`where the elven sorcerers `study and store their magical `tomes. If only I could gain `admittance to the tower and `browse the texts myself.``Journal Excerpt Eight``A member of my company has`acquired a set of High Elven `tomes that he claims have`come from the tower of the`Keepers of the Art, the`name the Koada'Dal sorcerers`have given to themselves.`He has not mentioned how`the books came to be in his`possession and I dare not`ask until we are far beyond`the gates of this city.`Tolsarian has agreed to take `us through the Faydark to the `borders of the Steamfont `Mountains, home of the`Gnomes, creatures of distant`relation to the dwarves of `Butcherblock. I do not look `forward to another stay in a `subterranean city but from `what I have heard of the`gnomes, the discomfort may`be rewarded with knowledge`pertaining to my interests. I`am also eager to be away`from the condescending`nature of the Koada'Dal,`despite the magnificence of`their city and the wonders`they possess.`Some of my company find`my reaction to the demeanor`of the high elves to be amusing but I do not share`in their humor.``Journal Excerpt Nine``The Steamfont Mountains are `unlike any mountain range I `have beheld. Great geysers `jettison steam and scalding `water into the air and mist `and fog blankets the ground `and sky. Tolsarian has left `our company for the time`being and will await our`return at a small elven`outpost in the Faydark not`far from the borders of`Steamfont. I have begun`research to decipher the`texts that were acquired in `Felwithe but fear that what `few tomes I have brought with `me on the journey are not `sufficient for proper study `and I will not likely make `much progress with the elven `texts until I am able to `return to my study in Qeynos.`	2
ErudJourn4	Journal Excerpt Ten``My company and I have arrived `and been welcomed to the `Gnomish city of Ak'Anon, and I`must say, of all the things I `have seen on this journey the `city of the gnomes is the most`perplexing. The gnomes seem`to be equally adept at`creating material marvels as`well as magical ones.`There are contraptions here`far more mechanically`complex than those built`by any culture on Norrath,`including the advanced`human society from `which I hail. Unlike the high `elves of Felwithe, the gnomes `are eager to show my `companions and I the marvels `they have created, and are far`more curious about our past, `stories, and belongings than `any other peoples we have `encountered here in Faydwer.`I believe the gnomes attitude `toward my company will allow `me to inquire about their `magical practices and perhaps`even view the tomes they have `catalogued in their sorcerers `academy, The Library `Mechanamagica.``Journal Excerpt Eleven``A gnome magician of the `Eldrich Collective, the name `given to their arcane order, `has allowed me entry to the `Library Mechanamagica and `given me quick instruction on `the basics of the gnome `language. In exchange for `allowing the Eldrich `Collective to examine the `elven tomes I acquired in `Felwithe they are giving me `several copies of gnomish `arcane books containing `theories and practical `applications of the magical `arts. I am grateful that my `journey has led me to the `gnomish city despite my `original apprehension and `assumption that they would be `more similar to their distant `relatives the dwarves. It is `apparent that the gnomes are `highly civilized and extremely`intelligent, but I fear they `are a bit too trusting of `outsiders and that congenial `trait may one day cause them `to suffer. In a few days time `my company and I shall once `again meet up with the `half-breed Tolsarian and he `shall escort us back through `the Faydark and Butcherblock `Mountains to the docks so that`we may charter passage on a `ship back to Antonica. That `should give the drunkards `among my companions`sufficient time to recover`from their consumption`of Gnomish Spirits.`From Freeport we shall`charter another ship to`carry us around the coastline `of Antonica and back to our `homes in Qeynos.`I am eager to return to my`study and learn all I`can of these elven and `gnomish arcane tomes I have `acquired.`	2

Several extremely`deadly poisons can now be`safely concocted and stored`with the aid of the ETHEREAL`SUSPENSION and a SEALED VIAL.``The sap of two parts crushed`CREEPER IVY will stiffen the`muscles of the victim.``Two crushed IVORY POPPIES`with a single crushed FROSTY`DATURA will be the bane of a`magic wielding victim.``Two parts NOHOPE MOSS and one`SNOWCAP AMANITA will make`the immune system of your`victim susceptible to harm`from the elements.``The dead SHRIVELED FLESH of`the armies that haunt`Kithicor when made into an`injected fluid will cause a`tremendous atrophy of the`victim's muscle strength. Two`parts flesh have proven`sufficient.``Two parts SCORPIKIS VENOM`extracted from the monsters'`stingers enhances the venom,`making it even more painful`and deadly.``Two chunks of CRYSTALLIZED`SULFUR and one part SUCCULENT`SAP will cause a deadly rage`in the victim as they`suffer extreme pain and often`death.``Two piles of SPIROC BONE DUST`and one part SKYASH BILE will`cause the victim's bones to`become brittle while granting`them swiftness of motion.``A particularly incapacitating`poison can be created with`two portions of MT. DEATH`MINERAL SALTS and one vial of`QUICKSILVER.``An intense vertigo can be set`upon a victim with a poison`concocted of one part CRYSTAL`NIGHTSHADE, one part BLACK`HENBANE, and one DEATH CAP.``The most pain inducing poison`that I have discovered yet is`created with two parts BLOOD`THORN EXTRACT and one part`EMERALDBERRY CYANIDE.``This is as much information`as I have gathered through my`experimentation with the new`ethereal suspension. Perhaps`in time I shall learn more.	10
EVE2Diary	The day of my ultimate power `has finally arrived.  Today `will be the culmination of `years of searching and `studying.  Each of my three `camps is guarding one of the `three runes of chaos.   At the`hour of midnight, our forces `will combine and I will `complete my studies.  For it `is said whoever combines the `rune of eternal life, rune of `eternal mana and rune of `ultimate chaos, will live `forever and become godlike in `power.  Once this is achieved,`I will be very busy creating `my new kingdom.  Those who do `not obey my words will suffer `eternal agony for my pleasure.` My only worry is I have been `told Mordag is on my trail.  `If he were to get the runes, `my plans would be ruined.  I `must do all within my power to`make sure this does NOT `happen.  I will let Nothing `and No one get in my way!!!	0

Get your resumes ready.``There is plenty of employment and work required for this ship which Rasp has called, "the biggest ship the world has ever seen."``~Citizen Called by Wayfarers~``The Herald has learned that one of our very own citizens has been called upon to help with the Wayfarers Brotherhood.``Est Treewalker was contacted recently by Jilsuia Lluarea about his knowledge of carpentry.``"While much of my time is consumed with the art of enchantment, I have spent a lot of time doing carvings and learning the properties of all the types of wood available in our lands," Treewalker said.``The consultation lasted for several days as Treewalker offered details about the best types of wood and methods for building a vessel as large as the ship described to him.``"I didn't see the plans for the ship, but the description given to me by Jilsuia suggests that we will certainly be impressed by the magnitude of this undertaking,"  Treewalker stated.``Treewalker said he may be called upon to help with the project in the near future.``	0

Palace`staff wouldn't comment on`neither why it was believed`the staff was taken to that`location, nor whether Firiona`herself, chosen of Tunare, had`returned to Velious in pursuit`of the thieves.``Meanwhile, rumors imply`something that resides deep in`the Tower of Frozen Shadow may`have the power to strip`Tunare's influence from the`staff.  Such a notion is`obviously ridiculous, but`there remains the possibility`that the scoundrels in`possession of the artifact`might have been attempting`something toward that end.``Palace staff assures us that`the Lifeguide's return to the`sanctity of Felwithe is`imminent.`````Strange Reports from Antonica``--------------c----------------``All over Antonica, phenomena`as yet without explanation has`been reported.

fletching	A FIELD GUIDE TO FLETCHING`THIRD EDITION``Fletching, the art of making`arrows from component pieces,`is one of the oldest weapon`crafts on Norrath.``This tome details the`construction of arrows, as`well as providing`information on the sister`craft of the Bowyer.``Bowyers and Fletchers both`require Fletching Kits to`practice their trades.``Fletching kits can be`purchased from archery shops.`````ARROWS``There are four parts to every`arrow.``Generally, the cheaper the`part, the easier it is to`assemble.``Expensive components produce`superior arrows.``NOCK``There are three types of`nocks, differentiated by the`size of their grooves.  The`larger the groove, the easier`the arrow is to make.  The`smaller the groove, the`farther the arrow travels.````SHAFT``The shaft of the arrow can`be made from a variety of`different materials.  The`most common material used for`shafts is wood.  Bone shafts`are stronger than wood, and`Porcelain stronger than Bone.``Steel is the strongest material`used for arrow shafts.`TIP``There are many designs for`arrow tips.  The most common`is the point tipped arrow.`Slightly more damaging is the`hooked tip - its small`blades cause tearing and`bleeding.  Actual bladed`arrows do more damage than the`hook tipped arrows, though`they are easier to remove.`FLETCH``The fletch, or feathering, of`the arrow influences the`distance the arrow travels,`as well as the impact`delivered upon a successful`hit.``The easiest pattern to`fletch is a round cut.``Slightly more difficult is`the parabolic cut, whose spin`gives the arrow additional`flight range.``The shield cut fletch pattern`has a shorter range than`either the round or the`parabolic cut, but produces`a spin providing superior`armor penetration.`RESTRINGING BOWS`The strings of bows are`interchangable and various`strings will provide greater`range, damage, or quickness.	-1
FoHateV1	Tale Written by Qa Eilzoa `Ta'Vra, sister of fallen `shadowknight Kzaeka Ta'Vra``Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`              Volume I``The Port Authority office `of Butcherblock Mountains `heard rumors of two `Teir'Dal seeking a relic in`the Ocean of Tears. It was `rumored that this relic `could be used to contact `Innoruuk with ease. The `officer sent forces of his `own to stop the Teir'Dal `from obtaining it. Just as `they managed to get one `Teir'Dal down to minimal `life, he passed off the `relic to his companion who `then fled for safety `quickly returned to Neriak `with the relic in tact.``A dark elf messenger headed`from the Broken Skull Rock `to Neriak to deliver a `sealed note to Warlock Xon `Quexill, the Overseer of `the Lodge of the Dead. `Unfortunately, he `encountered a barrier in `the Qeynos area and failed `at his mission. The city of`Qeynos learned of his `attempt to get to Neriak `with the message and a `small force ambush him the `Teir'Dal before he could `make it.``Over the next few days, `other messengers made `attempts to deliver the `message to Neriak from the `Broken Skull Rock but `failed as well.``Officer R'nar, a junior `officer of the Koada'Vie, `was placed in change of `investigating several `reports of assassination `attempts on key officials `in Felwithe. She hired a `few volunteer troops to `help track down a dark elf `that was hiding out in the `Faydark. Once they caught `him, he tried to escape but`they managed to kill him `and found a message that `they could barely make out.`However, they were able to `determine that a very `important meeting was going`to be taking place in `Neriak that night.``Officer R'nar requested `that her volunteers meet up`with her later in the `Commonlands while she `figured out a way for them `to find out what was going `to happen with the meeting.``Another messenger headed `from the Broken Skull Rock `to Neriak to deliver a `sealed note to Warlock Xon `Quexill.

Fortunately, the `attackers killed a decoy `and the real messenger `managed to get to Neriak.``Officer R'nar met back up `with her volunteers. She `gave a few of them illusion`potions and sent them into `Neriak to spy on the `meeting. Others she sent to`Najena to retrieve a book `that was stolen from `Felwithe.``In Neriak, Queen Cristanos `Thex addressed the Lodge of`the Dead. She informed them`of the letter that was sent`to Neriak from the Broken `Skull Rock from Arch Lich `T'Vaxok, an Advisor of `Hate. The letter read. . .``Warlock Xon Quexill,``These are the words of our `Master, the commands of our`Prince. Listen well, and `obey.``Plans have been set in `motion, strategies in which`you and the Lodge of the `Dead have a part. You need `only look to the Gulf to `see our first steps. The `loyal on Broken Skull Rock `spread pain with every `prayer, and Luggalds surge `throughout the region. Hate`grows, warlock. Our Master `stirs!``But these successes cast a `shadow on your own. Your `followers have grown fat on`routine and stability. They`mouth prayers they should `fear. Such complacency must`be purged, for now is not `the time to honor tradition`at the expense of effect. `Spend a few lives to make `your point. But make it.``For you see, even as I `write, our power grows. `Mithaniel's blessing of the`frogloks enraged our `Master. And he has shared `His rage. The denizens of `this plane howl with new `vigor, and my own abilities`have increased ten fold. `The very stones around me `sing with His righteous `anger. Buildings have been `reformed, streets turned to`other ends. No longer will `mortal intruders have easy `access to the heart of our `Hate.``This is why you must act `now to cull your ranks. The`weak cannot share in this `new inheritance or hinder `our advance. This black `birthright is only for the `strong.

It `peered at those below with `great concern and began to `speak in an ancient `language, but allowed the `children of hate to `understand.``"My creations, I have `gained much power through `the worship of my new `followers. I have merged `with those that have `already sacrificed `themselves to me. The time `shall soon come when I `shall use my power to take,`that which is rightly mine.`There is one more sacrifice`my followers need to make `in order for my power to be`released. With the failure `of my chosen child of hate,`Lanys T'Vyl, I have now `chosen a sacrifice that is `not of elf blood. With the `power that I have received `from the worshippers on the`Broken Skull Rock, I have `the thirst for the `sacrifice of a stronger `nature. The final sacrifice`must be a troll. I have `already selected the chosen`troll, but will not reveal `my choice until the time `has come that I will need `this troll. Until then, you`will need to prepare each `troll worthy of being `sacrificed to me. Once the `trolls have been prepared `for the ritual, the `sacrifice may be made. `Continue to hate those who `oppose me and once my full `power has been realized, `darkness shall reign over `Norrath and beyond."``The Vision of Hate then `disappeared. The Teir'Dal `King and Queen came to an `agreement that the Grant `Ritualist would oversee the`preparations for the `sacrifice. Willing trolls `would be called forward `over the days following and`would be prepared for the `ritual.`	0
FoHateV4	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`           Volume IV``The spies quickly headed to`meet back up with Officer `R'nar to communicate what `they had overheard.``The next day Officer R'nar `gathered additional `volunteers. She told them `that they must make every `effort to track down the `sacrificial troll before `the ritual could take `place. She had learned of a`troll that that was being `escorted to Neriak by `several Teir'Dal troops. `However, they had no way of`knowing if this troll was `the chosen one or not. `Unfortunately for them, `their efforts did not stop `the movement.``Later that day, Officer `R'nar furthered attempts to`stop the sacrifice. Spread `across the lands near `Freeport and Highpass Hold,`dark elf campsites were in `the process of being set up`to act as guard stations `for protection of the `trolls heading to Neriak. `Each camp was assigned a `steward to handle the `disbursement of supplies. `Corporal Vi'Dar, a dark elf`quartermaster was traveling`to bring supplies to these `camps. Officer R'nar `gathered forces to clear `out the campsites before `the Corporal could arrive. `As they cleared the `campsite, they retrieved `armament crates but found `that the Teir'Dal Corporal `had already visited the `campsites and the `containers were emptied. `Their ambush was too late.``After a Vision of Hate `appeared before the `Teir'Dal King and Queen `last evening and gave word `that a troll must be `sacrificed but did not `mention which he has `chosen, several trolls `traveled back to Neriak to `meet up with a `representative curious `whether or not they were `selected as the chosen one.``The representative informed`them that they would not `know who would be the `sacrifice until the time of`the ritual a few days from `then. Because they did not `know who was going to be `the sacrifice, all of those`willing were prepared over `the course of a few days.`	0
FoHateV5	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`            Volume V``For the ritual, the Grand `Ritualist hired several `forces to retrieve supplies`make the Sacrificial Ritual`Temper. This temper would `be used to prepare the `trolls at the time of the `sacrifice. Led by the dark `Tharknight, they quickly `agreed to assist the Grand `Ritualist with the `gathering of these `ingredients.``They set forth to retrieve `black sapphires, a leg of `an ancient froglok from the`depths of Guk, the brain of`a Tae Ritualist from the `Accursed Temple of `Cazic-Thule, dried dragon `blood and high elf blood.``Meanwhile, Officer R'nar `attempted to find `information about where the`Sacrificial Ritual was `going to be held. She had `learned of several `ritualists that were `spotted in the Rathe `Mountains. She sent `volunteers there to see if `they could found out any `information or stop these `ritualists from reaching `wherever the ritual was `being held.``Upon slaying one of the few`Grand Ritualists, they `collected a Plain `Parchment. Officer R'nar `gave the parchment Lyssla `Tyslin, a High Wizard of `Felwithe so that she could `determine what it was for.``Lyssla was able to discover`that the parchment was not `plain. Words written on the`parchment were written in `an ancient language, but `Lyssla was able to make out`that it referred to a Tome `of Sacrifice. Officer R'nar`told her volunteers that if`they could retrieve this `tome they might be able to `use it to stop the ritual `from taking place.``Unfortunately, retrieving `the tome meant that they `had to enter the realm of `Hate.  After a deadly `infiltration, they managed `to retrieve the Tome and `proceeded to take it to `Juxta Klawse in the `Commonlands. Their sources `told them that Juxta Klawse`was a wood elf rogue who `had some knowledge of the `Teir'Dal ancient language `and might be able to `transcribe the tome for `them.`	0
FoHateV6	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`           Volume VI``Upon entering the `Commonlands, Officer R'nar `and her companions got `ambushed by hundreds of `Teir'Dal forces including `Juxta Klawse who was `actually Teir'Dal himself. `They did their best to `fight them off but Officer `R'nar and Lyssla Tyslin `fell on the battlefield.``Priest Lynndel L'hwin `brought back those who `could be resurrected but `was unable to do anything `for Officer R'nar and `Lyssla Tyslin At the end of`the battle, their comrades `set up a memorial for them `to keep their corpses pure `until they passed on to `Tunare.``While Coercer Nanyea `assisted her dark brethren `against those opposing `Innoruuk, the Teir'Dal `forces retrieved the Tome `of Sacrifice leaving the `ritual unable to be `stopped.``As a final preparatory step`for the ritual, A Grand `Ritualist sent followers of`Innoruuk to retrieve Vials `of Holy Acid. Three High `Priests out West Karana `were holding these vials. `Each priest was at a `heavily guarded tower along`the Pass. These hired hands`managed to defeat two of `the towers, however, `Teir'Dal reinforcements `were called in to finish of`the final tower.``As the sacrificial ritual `grew nearer, the Grand `Ritualist told the `worshippers that The `Thaumaturge in graveyard of`Castle Mistmoore would be `the one to forge the `Sacrificial Ritual Temper `once she received the `ingredients. She gave them `a box filled with the `ingredients to Arch Mage `Shandal to bring to The `Thaumaturge. In addition, `she gave Nanyea a sealed `note for The Thaumaturge, `which contained the `location of the ritual.`	0
FoHateV7	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`          Volume VII``With music and chants `echoing throughout Castle `Mistmoore, safe passage was`granted to those who served`Lord Innoruuk. As entourage`of flowerers approached the`graveyard, the minions of `Mistmoore stood and watched`closely.``Once The Thaumaturge `received the box of `ingredients, she placed the`leg and brain in a pot. She`then grabbed the head of `the high elf and let the `blood drip over the pot.``Next, she poured the `contents of the red vial, `the yellow vial, and the `green vial of acid in the `pot as it begin to hiss, `spit and smoke. Those in `attendance slowly backed `away from the pot.``The pot immolated with `burning flames. The `Thaumaturge reached her `hand into the burning pot `while holding an empty `bottle. She then pulled out`the Sacrificial Ritual `Temper and sealed it.``She then read the note that`was given to her earlier `and informed those in `attendance where to go for `the ritual. Tserrina `Syl'Tor granted them the `usage of a blood pool in `her Tower of Frozen Shadow `for the ritual but did not `guarantee their safe `passage.``The time had come at last `for the ritual to take `place. The willing trolls `were escorted to the `continent of Velious with `the exception of one. `Evidently, a state of `delirium overcame one of `the trolls but he was dealt`with accordingly.`	0
FoHateV8	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`          Volume VIII``As they entered the Tower `of Frozen Shadow, they `informed the Grand `Ritualist of the success `with the temper and the `demise of The Thaumaturge. `She directed them to the `chapel area. Within the `chapel, the ushers were `lined up facing the alter, `as those in attendance `quickly moved to their `places in the aisles. The `trolls were called forward.``"All Hail and Praise `Innoruuk! The ritual will `commence!" the Grand `Ritualist exclaimed as she `began the ritual.``She wrote runes of fire in `the air, to cleanse herself`in the flames. Priest `Nerosiss then gave the `trolls the black sapphires `while the Ritualist was `saying, "May these dark `stones act as mediums for `Hate to course through `these troll's souls."``She then opened the vial of`Sacrificial Temper and `poured drops of the dark `elixir over the head of `Shaman Galbadia and `Bubbaflex the Warrior. `Their bodies cleansed in `pain as their souls filled `with a greater sense of `hate.``The Grand Ritualist `attempted to sacrifice `Galbadia, however, was `prevented from doing so. `She then turned toward `Bubbaflex and tried to `sacrifice him.``Unfortunately, after the `troll was sacrificed `nothing happened. With the `Tome of Sacrifice in hand, `the Grant Ritualist tried `to determine why the `sacrifices did not work.``At that moment, a scent of `darkness reached down and `grabbed at Galbadia, `stripping all essence of `life from his body. His `pained blood splattered `across the chapel. The `Prince of Hate then `returned to his realm, `taking with him the essence`of Galbadia the Sacrificed.`There was nothing left of `Galbadia but a weakened `bodied.``The Grant Ritualist quickly`brought the news back to `Neriak. The Royal Family `declared that every `Teir'Dal was to murder at `least one being of good to `further honor the Prince of`Hate. `	0
FoHateV9	Fortifying Innoruuk's Realm`          Volume IX``As she entered the portal `to Antonica, Kzaeka Ta'Vra,`a master dark knight of `Innoruuk, prepared for her `journey to the Commonlands `to aide her brothers and `sisters in the time of `Hate. Upon her arrival to `the forsaken land, she `quickly raised several evil`creatures from the dead.``Her newly created minions `roamed the Commonlands `slaying anyone that got in `their way. Trens Treesap, a`mere halfling, gathered as `many volunteers as he could`to try to fight off dark `powers as Kzaeka warned `them that they will all `soon bow down to the Prince`of Hate.``Unfortunately, despite her `triumphs over hundreds of `attackers, Kzaeka Ta'Vra `was soon defeated.``Forces hailing from `Freeport, Qeynos and all `about Faydwer continued to `steel their nerves `defending off attackers on `what proved to be a bloody `and dangerous day.``All Hail and Praise `Innoruuk!

GloxNote	Glox's Instructions                                  Atop the ancient tower of Kurn lives a mole. This mole has unwittingly taught the Swifttails much. It has taught us focus. Go into the tower, sit and meditate near his burrow, and settle yourself. When it peers out to look for food, use all your pent up ferocity and kill the mole quickly. Upon it's neck will be a collar. Return to me the collar and 2 star rubies and I will give you my reference for the Arcut..	18
GmistNotes	I made these notes from my `interpretation of the Sarnak `tome. ``Read them carefully.``The weaponsmith who created `the Greenmist still exists in `some form.  He has been `tormented for a very long time`and may not remember his art. `If this is the case, there may`still be some chance of `recovering the design of the `sacred blade.  The key lies `with the Lich-King's beloved.``It is rumored the lich had a `mirror created that allows his`beloved Drusella to see her `former self in its reflection.` Perhaps this artifact can `offer you some assistance in `this quest.``Several items will be needed `to recreate the Greenmist `Khukri.  A special hammer was `specifically created to fold `and sculpt the weapon's blade.` Both the Greenmist and this `hammer were created on the `same day.  Only the year is `known.  The year was 1406.  `The tome mentions that the `Sarnak were actively seeking `the tool.``The formula that will be `needed to smelt the Tynnonium `is written in the back of this`book.  Use this book when you `find the forge needed to `create the Khukri. You will `need a design pattern, the `block of Tynnonium, the `hammer, and this tome to `create the Greenmist blade.``To finish the weapon, you will`need the Lord of Pain's `Khukri, this tome, the hammer,`the Greenmist blade, and a `Greenmist shard or fragment. `We have not found any `Greenmist fragments.``All items must be forged in `the hottest of all forges, the`Forge of Dalnir.```May the will of Cazic-Thule `guide you``---Zimor`	18
GNORobe1	Library of Mechanamagica `Tailoring Study I``Under the tutelage of the `Library of Mechanamagica I `have begun to fashion robes`that will be distributed to`all gnomes of arcane `interest.  First I have `brewed together dye from `our lands to strengthen the`power of the ribbons that `will be used to tie the `gowns together:``Steam Dye: Steamfont Spring`Water, Flask of Water``Cauldron Dye: Cauldron `Prawn, Flask of Water``Next, using a tailoring kit`to pin down the ribbon,  I `dyed them with the essence `of our lands.  Shears are `used to cut them to length:``Silvery White Ribbon: Steam`Dye, Silver Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Silvery Seagreen Ribbon: `Cauldron Dye, Silver `Ribbon, and Hickory Handled`Shears``Golden White Ribbon: Steam `Dye, Gold Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Golden Seagreen Ribbon: `Cauldron Dye, Gold Ribbon, `and Elm Handled Shears``Platinum White Ribbon: `Steam Dye, Platinum Ribbon,`and Elm Handled Shears``Platinum Seagreen Ribbon: `Cauldron Dye, Platinum `Ribbon, and Elm Handled `Shears``Next I began creating the `swatches the robes will be `tailored from.  Using an `advanced research book as `reference, I copied down `the research component `using a quill and piece of `parchment:``Neglect Scried Swatch: `Words of Neglect``Breath Etched Swatch: `Breath of Ro``Astral Runed Swatch: Rune `of The Astral``Tashani Scribed Swatch: `Page 15 Toharon's Memoir `(Right Side)``Expertise Etched Swatch: `Words of Expertise``Intellect Scribed Swatch: `Page 25 Yaeth's Compendium `(Right Side)`	8
GNORobe2	Library of Mechanamagica `Tailoring Study II``Next a special needle is `needed that will not draw `power from the ribbons `being sewn into the robes. `Because it has the essence `of our lands added to it, `the power of the ribbon `remains intact:``Clockwork Needle: `Embroidering Needle, `Clockwork Essence``Now that the previous were `done I could then begin `tailoring the robes!  Using`a Clockwork Needle and an `Oxidized Robe Pattern as a `guide I fashioned the `following:``Robe of Neglect: Neglect `Scried Swatch, Silvery `White Ribbon``Robe of Breath: Breath `Etched Swatch, Silvery `Seagreen Ribbon``Robe of the Astral: Astral `Runed Swatch, Golden White `Ribbon``Robe of Tashani: Tashani `Scribed Swatch, Golden `Seagreen Ribbon``Robe of Expertise: `Expertise Etched Swatch, `Platinum White Ribbon``Robe of Intellect: `Intellect Scribed Swatch, `Platinum Seagreen Ribbon`	8

GREMyr1	Day 1`---------`Today is a great day, so I `shall begin this journal.  The`High Inquisitor has called for`my skilled hand to create for `him a set of armor, which `cannot be pierced by any `weapon.  This is to be my last`chance to be in good grace `with Lord Seru, though I have `denounced Katta I assume they `can still sense that I miss my`family.  Regardless, I shall `begin working with the `materials that were supplied `to me in the morning.``Day 2`---------`Creation is going steady; the `ore is melting to my `expectations.  This metal, `which I have named Yttrium, `should not be able to be `pierced.  I have sent for `items to help tint the armor `as Lord Seru requests.``Day 10`-----------`With the greaves complete I `begin working on the `Breastplate soon.  I have `discovered how to make perfect`Yttrium Sheets so production `should go faster.  Mixing two `bricks of Yttruim ore, with `one Vial of Quicksilver Temper`creates the perfect sheet.  `The Quicksilver Temper is a `harder mixture though, I must `request ingredients be brought`to me often, they seem to be `hard to come by.  For the `perfect hue I have been `brewing one part Fungoid Sap, `one part Meteor Dust, one part`Shissar Blood, and one part `Shiknar Ichor.  I do not know `where the Consillium of the `Hand is acquiring these `ingredients, nor do I care, as`long as I can present Lord `Seru with a fine set of armor.``Day 18`----------`I have finished Lord Seru's `Breastplate and just returned `from presenting the Praesertum`with it.  They shall take it `to him soon, so I should get `word in a week.  I shall wait `to see if this is enough to `please Lord Seru.  I shall `begin work on weapons that can`match the armor, in the case `that it doesn't.	16
GREMyr2	Day 22`----------`Success!  I have created an `entire arsenal that should be `able to strike through his `armor.  I had the most success`using the following: A Pommel `Mold, Hilt Mold, one Vial of `Quicksilver Temper, one `Yttrium Steel Sheet, and `either a Dagger, Short, `Curved, or Long Blade mold `created a fine blade.  An Oak `Shaft, one Vial of Quicksilver`Temper, one Yttrium Steel `Sheet, and either a Mace, `Hammer, or Axe Head Mold `created heavier, powerful `weapons.  For a powerful set `of gloves, I used two High `Quality Rockhopper Pelts, one `Vial of Quicksilver Temper, `and one Yttrium Steel Sheet.  `A bow made with an Oak Bow `Staff, a Silk String, a `Planing Tool, one Yttrium `Sheet Metal, and one Vial of `Quicksilver Temper imbues any `arrow shot from it with the `same properties.  `Should I be banished, I will `create these weapons for `Recuso to destroy Seru.````Day 25`-----------`The inevitable has happened.  `My time for the question has `arisen, even though too soon. `I failed because of my longing`for my family Katta.  I know `their ways are wrong but I of `course still love them.  I `write into this log from a `land of destitution, I have `been named a Recuso.`Day 49`----------`A few days ago in search of `shelter from the rain I `stumbled inside this place.  `What is this place... my `nightmares become reality.  I `feel as though I am being `watched with every step.  I `can not remember the way out, `I can not remember... `anything.	16
GromokVol1	The Chronicle of Gromok Hergom```I ink these words for fear `that my once proud and mighty `Ogres will forget the events I`have seen in my long life. I `am known at the time of this `inking as Elder Gromok but I `was once a soldier of little `renown and status in the `mighty Rallosian Legions`under the command of Warlord `Murdunk. I was not raised to `be an Elder of my fellow `Ogres. My training was that of`a soldier and I concerned `myself only with the arts of `warfare. It is with reluctance`that I now bear the mantle of `Elder and the cause of that `reluctance is the same reason `that I ink this tale.`I was stationed at the `Fortress of Krithgor when the `ogre magi first opened the `portals to the Planes of `Power. Plans were quickly laid`and orders sent to our `fortresses and troops in all `corners of Tunaria. A large `invasion force of Ogres, `Giants, Orcs, and Goblins `gathered at the newly opened `planar portals. At the time I `felt disappointed that my `orders were to remain at `Fortress Krithgor, that `disappointment quickly turned `to anger when I learned that `the invasion failed, and `although Warlord Murdunk `survived our losses were `great.`Some time passed before`news reached the Fortress`of Krithgor that a second `invasion was being `orchestrated. Rumors circled `like hungry buzzards over a `field of carnage concerning `the plans for this second `invasion. It was even said `that Rallos Zek was to lead `the campaign with Warlord `Murdunk and the most`renowned champions of`the Giants, Orcs, and`Goblins by his side. Once `again my orders were to`remain at the home front`to defend the women,`children, and elderly`citizens of the Rallosian`Empire.`It was not long after the `invasion forces of the `Rallosian Legions once again `passed through the portals to `the Planes of Power that the `home front too became a place`of battle, slaughter, and `glory. Mortal disciples of `deities opposed to The `Warlord, Rallos Zek, attacked `the citizens and fortresses of`the Rallosian Empire on `Tunaria. Our enemies fought `valiantly, and the resulting `battles were the most glorious`I was ever to behold. My `weapons and armor were` stained with the blood of`our foes, and our children`and elders kept safe within`our impenetrable strongholds.`Messengers passing through`the Fortress of Krithgor spoke`of the victories of the legion`units led by Rallos Zek, `Warlord Murdunk, and the `Generals Tallon and Vallon. It`was said that the Rathe `Council, the twelve rulers of `the Plane of Earth had been `captured and forced to Norrath`where they were being executed`by Murdunk and his Generals, `that mountains burst from the `earth where the gods fell and `that the dying tears of the `fallen gods formed a cold, `deep lake between the newly `risen mountain peaks.`	7
GromokVol2	At the height of victory it `happened, I know not what `fearful deities are`responsible, nor what ancient`magics were unleashed on`my people and our brethren`races of the Rallosian Empire.`I know only what I myself `witnessed at the accounts of `the other survivors of what is`spoken of only as The Curse.`The first signs I saw of the `curse were the angry shouts of`the ogre magi when the planar `portals closed. Then the `screams of those same magi`as fire simultaneously`ignited from within their`bodies leaving only memories`and ashes.`Shortly after witnessing the `demise of the magi stationed `at the Fortress of Krithgor a `battered legion unit arrived `at the fortress gates. The `soldiers brought word of `Murdunks dishonorable death, `accusing The Rathe of cursing `Murdunk to fall from a cliff `at the site of The Rathes `execution. They spoke of the `disappearances of many great `Ogre war leaders, including `Murdunks tactician and `strategist, Generals Tallon `and Vallon, and even the `Warlord Rallos Zek. This worn `unit of soldiers was relieved `of their previous duties by `our superiors and stationed at`the Fortress of Krithgor. A `new Legion Unit was formed `from the soldiers that had `been stationed there for some `time, myself included, and we `were charged with completing `the duties of the reassigned `soldiers.`Days passed swiftly for me as`my legion unit traveled to `various fortresses and`battlefields. The sights`revealed to us at each arrival`to this day seem unreal. With`the great military leaders and`the magi dead or missing our`fortresses began to fall. The`Giants, also crippled with the`loss of their magi, retreated`deep into the wilderness. The`Orcs became obsessed with`greed and blood lust, dividing`from the Rallosian Empire into`petty clans fighting each`other over the spoils of the`war. The Goblins went mad`cowering in the shadows and`caverns of Tunarias frontiers.`We returned after many`months to the Fortress of`Krithgor to find the once`mighty stronghold reduced`to rubble like so many of the`fortresses we had visited on our patrol.`Whatever creatures had `destroyed the fortress had not`even spared women and`children, their remains lay `strewn about the stones that `once formed the strongholds`walls. This was when I gave in`to my pride and accepted that`the Rallosian Empire was no`more.`	7
GromokVol3	Freed of any obligations of `duty, the soldiers that`accompanied me and I set out `in search of a fortress that `had not yet fallen. We`traveled and fought for `countless weeks only to be`greeted by death and misery at`each destination, what`survivors did remain at the`ruined strongholds of our once`great empire often joined us `in our search for sanctuary or`at the very least a place to `rebuild our fallen society.`Gradually as we traveled `across Tunaria, what began`as a small unit from the`Fortress of Krithgor became`a large caravan of refugees.`We settled in the Feerott`Marshlands near the ruins of`one of the Rallosian Empires`greatest strongholds. A `handful of capable warriors `among us set out to the west `in search of survivors at the `locations of the Rathes `executions and the death of `Murdunk. Only two of the `search party returned alive. `They spoke of terrible `devastation, Giants that were `once allies of the Ogre people`attacking without provocation,`and of ferocious one-eyed `giants that now guarded the `valleys and canyons of the `Mountains of the Rathes `Demise.`So it came to pass that the `Feerott Marsh became the new`home of we, the Ogre people.`The men took on duties of `hunting food in addition to `protecting the women and `children from the wild beasts `of the marsh. The women`harvested and cultivated what`forms of crops could be grown`in the marshy soil. The `children did nothing, and this`instilled fear into our minds `and hearts.`The children born to us`survivors of the collapse of `the Rallosian Empire were`noticeably and frighteningly `different than children of`previous generations. This`new generation of Ogres was`for the most part hairless,`only females showed any`ability to grow hair and even`then it was thin and straggly.`The flesh of the youngsters`was of a paler complexion`and warty and course,`they suffered frequently from`conditions that turned their`eyes bloodshot, made their`noses runny, and they often`drooled incessantly. It soon`became apparent however`that these physical conditions`were the least of our worries`for they were still physically`strong and enduring. It was`their minds that concerned us`the most.`	7
GromokVol4	The new generation of Ogres`exhibited little to no`capacity to learn all but the `most menial of tasks. The `youngsters proved to be `incapable of understanding the`written languages and they `struggled with speech, often `communicating in grunts and `barely comprehendible babble.`We were hard on the first few `children of this new `generation. We did not yet `fully understand what was `happening and placed them in `dangerous situations or left `them stranded in the marsh to `fend for their own survival.`As time passed and our colony`dubbed Oggok, a word that the `youngsters could remember`and enunciate, grew in numbers`it became apparent to us`adults that a great curse had`been laid upon our offspring.`Every child being born`exhibited the same physical`and mental characteristics of`those first few of the new`generation. `Gone were the days of the `Rallosian Empire. No longer`would there be heroic olive`skinned warriors, their`dreadlocks adorned with`bones of their enemies,`brilliant minded tactitions`and strategist to ensure our`victories, or magi to wield`fierce magic and open portals`to even the realms of the Gods`themselves. I am old now, an`elder of my people because I`am among the last of the `pre-curse generations. I leave`these words that I now ink in `the care of the most astute of`the new generation Ogres, I`pray that they will endure `after I have gone to join`Rallos in the afterlife,`perhaps The Warlord will shed`some hope on my despair and`provide some answers as to`why his glorious Empire has`fallen.``---- Elder Gromok Hergom, `former soldier of the `Rallosian Legions.`	7

GuktaStone	The Soulstone of Gukta is `something that I have created `to help return to our new `home.  The stone was created `out of necessity.  As one of `the original Elders of the `city I was tasked with `searching the world for `treasure that we could use.  `Weapons of great magical power`are needed to defend our city.` One fateful night we stumbled`into the sweltering lair of `Lord Nagafen.  We slowly made `our way down to his lair.  We `were not after the gold, only `the more unique treasures.  `Lord Nagafen must have just `finished off a group of `adventurers because he was `sleeping near his gold hoard. `His snoring was so loud it `rattled the walls, and his `exhales filled the chamber `with flame.  My small band and`I crept against the walls `shadowed with spells.  We `loaded up as much artifacts as`we could hold.  We tried to `escape the lair with it but `the clanging of metal woke the`great beast.  Thankfully we `were able to escape with our `lives but at the cost of `having to drop all of our `bounty.  If we had the `Soulstone I am about to `describe we could have used it`to escape with all of the `artifacts of power in hand.``Using our most skilled pottery`artisans I called for the `Soulstone to be created.  On a`pottery wheel they used the `following to create the `unfired stone:``Idol Sketch, Large Block of `Magic Clay, Celestial Essence,`Vial of Distilled Mana, Gukta `Essence, Water Flask, and `Sculpting Tools.``The Gukta Essence was created `from plant life grown near our`home.  This is what helps to `tie the stone to this place.``Speckled Toadstool, Water `Flask.``Once the unfired stone was `created all that was left was `to fire it inside of a kiln.  `Special precaution was taken `to make sure all of the power `in it was sealed off :``Unfired Soulstone of Gukta, `High Quality Firing Sheet, and`Divine Crystalline Glaze.``Now that we possess this `powerful stone we are planning`a trip to visit our old `friends in the eye of Solusek `soon.``- Lokta Elder Sigig`	13

HUMRobe1	Academy of Arcane Science `Tailoring Study I``For the Academy of Arcane `Science I have been chosen `to create the robes that `the students of Arcane `Sciences will wear.  I have`made robes based in each `branch of the arcane.  To `further draw upon the power`of our lands I have taken `components from the ground `to help us to tap into its `power.  First the dye that `will be used to color the `ribbons is made:``Plains Dye: Plains Roots, `Flask of Water`Jaggedpine Dye: Plant `Shoot, Flask of Water``Next I have dyed the `ribbons.  This is much more`than mere ornamentation.  `The dye from the ground `will help to strengthen and`add power to the robe:``Silvery Cyan Ribbon: Plains`Dye, Silver Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Silvery Teal Ribbon: `Jaggedpine Dye, Silver `Ribbon, and Hickory Handled`Shears``Golden Cyan Ribbon: Plains `Dye, Gold Ribbon, and `Hickory Handled Shears``Golden Teal Ribbon: `Jaggedpine Dye, Gold `Ribbon, and Elm Handled `Shears``Platinum Cyan Ribbon: `Plains Dye, Platinum `Ribbon, and Elm Handled `Shears``Platinum Teal Ribbon: `Jaggedpine Dye, Platinum `Ribbon, and Elm Handled `Shears``Then using my ability in `researching spells, I have `made the swatches that the `robe will be tailored from.` Using a piece of parchment`and a quill I copied the `following research `components:``Mana Scribed Swatch: Page `90 Salil's Writ (Right `Side)``Scent Etched Swatch: `Essence of Rathe``Concussion Runed Swatch: `Rune of Concussion``Lodestone Scribed Swatch: `Flake of Lodestone``Obliteration Scried Swatch:`Words of Obliteration``Capacity Etched Swatch: `Words of Capacity	0

JewelCrft1	Molded Jewelry``This technique is the leg-`acy of jewelcraft master`Srettib, who was able to`draw upon the force of`mineral essence.  His`passion for working with`the rarest and most beau-`tiful stones quickly led`him to concoct a firm`setting to ensure the`precious stones would not`be lost (as was often the`case with previous wire`techniques).  His artistic`genius not only led him`to create molded settings,`but enabled him to convoke`the latent magical powers`within stones and externalize`them.  He coupled stones with`various metals to control`the outcome of the powers`he unleashed.``Every jewelcrafter learns`Srettib's techniques, and`in homage to his memory,`all other forms of`jewelcraft have been`abandoned.``Jewelcraft Master`Srettib's Instructions:``All jewelry carries a unique`charm. Exquisite stones`placed in the finest`crafted settings, are more`likely to release the force`of mineral essence.``Try various combinations.``Combine any stone with any`metal to create unique`jewelry. Precious stones`are generally cut so that`they will reflect the most`light.  Other stones may be`tumbled for a smooth surface`or left untumbled if they`have an interesting shape.`Pearls and crystals are`generally left natural.``Use the molds in your jewelry`kit and pour melted metal`into the mold, allow it to`cool and remove the metal`from the mold.``To add cut stones, carve`a pronged cup mold so that`the prongs are down and the`base of the cup is at the`top.``Weld the base of the cup`to the top of the ring,`bracelet, etc.  Insert the`stone into the cup and`carefully bend down the`prongs to trap the stone.``To add odd-shaped untumbled`stones, custom carve a mold`to fit the stone with the bottom`of the cup at the bottom`of the mold.  Pour a small`amount of melted metal into`the mold and immediately`insert the stone.  Allow to`cool and remove from the`mold.	-1

Kaborfus1	The Fusibility Study`             By Al'Kabor```Part 1: What is Fusibility?``By nature, most minerals have `some point at which they can `be melted. In order to `determine what that point is, `fusibility tests must be `conducted. Being a master of `the scientific art of `wizardry, I, of course, have `mastered this process. When `exposing a mineral ore to a `controlled amount of heat and `other factors, it slowly `shrinks, forming a liquid base`of particles.``Over the last few years, I `managed to collect several `samples of ore that produce a `unique output when subjected `to these fusibility tests.``My research continues . . .	0

While `speaking with him and enduring`his ill-tempered threats and `warnings toward me, I noticed `coral-like ore on the reef of `his domain. I managed to `collect a few samples of this `fascinating mineral.``This ore is composed of coral `reef shells, another `substance, not yet defined, `and is tightly compressed by `the water of the Kedge Keep.``Fusible Earthen Ore:``When those bumbling gnomes `destroyed the Hatch releasing `Yael and Dartain, minerals `from the Plane of the `Underfoot dispersed outward `onto the surrounding area.``This form of earthen ore is `one of the hardest substances `currently existing on Norrath `and is the source of the `earthen golems and elementals `who lurk in the Hole.``Fusible Igneous Ore:``I spent many months `researching upon the continent`of Kunark. I came across a `unique form of lava in the `Skyfire Mountains. These `mountains have several dormant`volcanoes filled with lava `waiting to erupt. It was `around one of these volcanoes `where I found fusible igneous `ore.``When volcanic lava cools it `forms into a hard-form `mineral. This mineral is by `far one of the hottest `minerals on Norrath and `requires extreme heat to melt.``Fusible Velium Ore:``Although he is usually a `bothersome individual, the `dwarven warrior Thubr `Axebringer has assisted me `with obtaining samples of `velium ore. He managed to find`a few rare pieces of it in the`Western Wastes of Velious.``Velium ore is the most unique `ore I have found so far. Its `composition relies heavily on `the coldness of the area it is`found. The cooler the area, `the more tightly compressed it`is likely to be.

By mixing`the velium ore with the other `three, I discovered quite an `extraordinary magical `compound. When cooled, the `velium caused the compound to `expand and quickly harden - `the outcome, a product that is`uniquely resistant to the `elements.``In order to make use of this `newly created substance, I `performed the experiment `again. This time, while `reciting a few incantations `that I have been working on.  `I then quickly poured the `compound into a mold of a `scepter while chilling it. `With the power of the chilled `fusible ore compound and the `spell incantation, I managed `to create quite an unusual `scepter artifact.``When held by a wizard of great`power, not unlike myself of `course, the magical energy of `the scepter flows throughout `the mind expanding the `intelligence while providing a`greater protection from the `elements. ``Needless to say, I would only `entrust a most loyal assistant`with the safeguarding of such `a powerful artifact.``At this time, Makil Rargon is `the only assistant whom I am `sure I can trust to continue `on with my fusibility `research.

KalDiary	<+> Today I met a gentleman of`the palace. . .   Behari.  As `his name implies, he travels `often on palace business, to `and from Katta Castellum `bearing messages of utmost `importance to the King `himself.  This is a station `that suits his charming `demeanor- I am embarrassed to `admit that within moments he `could have convinced me of `nearly anything!  Oh, and such`a meeting it was- I was `wandering out in the `courtyard, longing for a `change of scenery from these `walls.  My forced smile must `have belied the wanderlust in `my heart, it was no sooner `than I had bumped into him `(most literally, clumsy that I`am) that he spoke of the `sights he is free to see.  My,`how he knew just what to say! `A strong man and a handsome `voice, I do hope to see this `one again. . .``<+> It was as though the stars`and the heavens fell in `perfect harmony, for I had `never seen such a beautiful `night, not even in dream.  `Behari did come calling again,`as only a gentleman would.  `With the expressed permission `of my father (the look on his `face was enough alone for me `to agree, though I needed no `convincing), this man of the `world set a dinner for us `under the watchful eye of `Norrath in a quiet corner atop`the palace.  Everything was `simply perfect; the food (for `which he hunted and himself `cooked), the stars, the `enchanting breeze and the `touch of his hand on mine. . .` I could not know greater `fulfillment.``<+> I have little time to `write for the excitement, but `I want never to forget this `day!  The wedding is arranged `and just around the corner.  `Father is beside himself with `joy!  I am indeed the happiest`I could ever imagine being.``<+> Behari. . .  has been long`in returning home.  Tomorrow `was to be our day, but he is `almost a week gone missing.  I`cannot concentrate to write `further. . .  he must return `to me.  He simply must.	0

knocouncil1	Lord Tephys of the`Koada'Dal and Carson`McCabe of Highkeep`stared at each other with`long faces over the council`table in Highkeep. The`meetings were not going well.`Upon hearing of the`Teir'Dal's plans of conquest,`Tephys had immediately`dispatched word to Felwithe`petitioning help. He had yet`to hear a reply.``Carson's biggest problem in`drafting forces for Highkeep`was that most of the merchant`lords on the council were`just that, merchants. They`spoke endlessly of buying`their way out of the fight,`that the goblin was lying, or`that they should just cut`their losses and leave.``Carson and Tephys held no`such disillusions. They knew`that the Teir'Dal would not`bargain, and those that`surrendered were doomed to`a quick death at best, with a`long life of torture and`servitude being the`alternative.``"Have we received any word`from Antonius Bayle yet?" `Tephys asked, not for the`first time since the council`had convened.``"I'm afraid that my`messengers have returned`with the same news we`expected Lord Tephys," `Carson explained. "He`cannot lend us much`support, if any, in our`struggle. He is afraid,`and with good reason, that`were he to make any attempt`to do so the rival factions`in and around Qeynos would`be quick to take advantage`of the city. He envisions`everything from the gnolls`of Blackburrow overrunning`the city to the Bloodsabers`taking it from underneath`him. And the sad thing is,`I can't really say I blame`him." ``"What of Freeport?" asked`Taliman Yurick, the leader of`the cities brewing merchants.`"Surely they're in the best`position to help us,`practically bordering`Nektulos and all." ``"Freeport is in no position`to help us either," Lord`Tephys was quick to point`out. "The Militia and the`Paladins keep each other in`check constantly. Both know`that if either were to support`us the other side would`only use it as an excuse to`try and take complete control`of the city.  No my friends,`I'm afraid it looks like both`of the great cities of`Antonica will not be aiding`us in this fight. And we can`count the dwarves out as`well. As I suspected, my`emissaries to King Kazon`were met only by the`damned dwarven logic`of, 'all the more reason`we should stay here and`prepare to defend the`shores of Butcherblock'." ``"I too, have contacted my`people across the sea," spoke`Pracil Micus of the Erudite.`They have agreed only to`bring it up in the next High`Council meeting for`discussion, at which point`they may decide to send`some sort of help." ``"Great!" shouted Thubr`Axebringer. The prominent`dwarven smith from Kaladim`jumped up from his seat`fuming,  "The way ye blasted`Erudites discuss things in`yer meetins we should be`getting help just about this`time next decade!"  ``Indignant, Pracil Micus`retorted, "Why you little`bearded retch, I suppose I`should expect such manners`from a.." `"SILENCE!" bellowed Carson`as he banged his gavel upon`the table. "I'll have no`bickering between us,`especially at a time like`this. You think the Teir'Dal`are fighting over which of`them are going to attack us!?`No, they're not because they`ALL want to attack. And if`the stories I've heard of`late are indeed true, that`the Teir'Dal have indeed`united under this prophet,`this 'child of hate', then`we may not just be facing`a few Teir'Dal war parties,`but rather the whole of`Neriak itself!" ``"But Carson!" Taliman`protested, "If what you're`saying is true then we're`doomed already.  We have`no armies save the guard of`Highkeep, no allies to call`upon, and all against an`entire nation of Dark Elves!"`	0
knocouncil2	"Perhaps you are not alone`as you think my friends,"`said a voice from the crowd.`Two high elves step forward,`resplendent in their ornate`armor.  One, an older male`with lines of battle etched`into his face, the other is a`younger female with the`beauty of a goddess herself.`Both appeared to be a bit`travel worn but fully armed.``Lord Tephys stood, an`obvious wave of relief`flashing across his face.`"Ladies and Gentlemen of`the council, allow me to`introduce Galeth Veredeth,`High Paladin of Tunare and`chief advisor to King Thearis`Thex."  The members of the`council were impressed and`quickly invited the newcomers`to join their meeting.  ``"Thank you Tephys my old`friend," Galeth said with a`look of sympathy for the`tired elven Lord.  "The young`lady accompanying me is`Firiona Vie, Paladin of`Tunare and my finest student`yet."``Firiona bowed politely to the`table saying, "The honor is`mine your lordships." ``"Ah yes!" said Tephys with`sudden recognition.  "You`have truly grown in the grace`of Tunare since last I saw`you young Firiona, we`welcome you to our table.`Now, please tell me you`bring good news Galeth." ``"Indeed I do," replied the`Paladin.  "I'm pleased to`announce that the entirety`of the Paladins of Tunare`are at your disposal."  ``Cheers erupted from the`council and the crowd.`Galeth holds up his hand for`silence and continues, "As`we speak our legions are`sailing across the Ocean of`Tears and should arrive in`a fortnight. The remainder`of the Koada'Dal forces shall`have to remain in Faydark`however, as we are constantly`besieged by the orcs of`Crushbone.  This is all King`Tearis can spare. The only`stipulation we insist upon is`that Lord Tephys must lead`the armies defending`Highkeep."  ``Lord Tephys attempted to`argue against this at first,`but was quickly and`unanimously outvoted as the`entire council, led by Carson`McCabe, insisted that it was`a grand idea.  A messenger`stepped forward and`whispered something in`Carson's ear.  ``Carson stood with a smile on`his face and spoke, "In`addition to this most`fortunate news, I've just`been informed that`adventurers from all over`Norrath are volunteering by`the dozens to aid our cause!"`Again the crowd and council`were swept away by rampant`cheers of thanks.  ``Lord Tephys once again stood`and addressing everyone said,`"With that said gentlemen, I`believe this council is`adjourned.  We all have a lot`of plans to make and little`time to spare. By the grace`of Tunare, we just might have`a chance."	0
knodeadtime1	Raex and Vindor``Long ago in the Kingdom of`Skaxron lived two childhood`friends, Raex, and Vindor.`The friends played, fought,`competed and grew up`together in their lawful`kingdom. As they matured`both young men proved`to be the greatest warriors`of their generation.`They became pledged as`knights in service to their`good King Randall. Two`years after the knighting of`Raex and Vindor, the War`of Ages engulfed their`continent, separating the`friends as they fought to`save their beloved kingdom.`War raged for many years,`their good King Randall was`slain, and all the lands were`put under the rule of an iron`fisted dark emperor.``Raex and Vindor survived`these lean years as`mercenaries and swore`complete and utter vengeance`upon the dark emperor that`ruled the land. They did not`have long to wait, for a`great and ancient evil was`listening. Bertoxxulous, Lord`of Decay, heard the plea and`offered to assist Raex and`Vindor for their permanent`indentured servitude. For the`Plague Lord knew they were`among the greatest of`warriors, and would aid him`greatly in his rise to power.`Blinded by vengeance Raex`and Vindor immediately`agreed to the deal. With`a snap of his fingers,`Bertoxxulous banished`his servant, the dark`emperor, to another`realm and accepted the two`great warriors into his`service, for they did not`know Bertoxxulous had`conquered their world just to`bring them into the ranks of`his minions.`````Carprin Deatharn``Long ago on the continent of`Antonica, within the world of`Norrath, there existed a`small village known as`Yawnwater. The village of`Yawnwater was a typical`village, with happy villagers`and flowers that grew all`about the town. In the middle`of the village stood a small`shrine dedicated to the`goddess of love, Erollisi`Marr, located right off of a`small river that flowed down`into a great lake. However`all did not remain right`within the happy little`village of Yawnwater.``On a dark night when the`moon was just a sliver in the`night sky, terror and`destruction came down upon`the happy little village of`Yawnwater. The dark knight,`Carprin Deatharn, determined`to prove to his god,`Bertoxxulous, Lord of Decay,`that he was an exalted`spreader of corruption and`decay that none could match,`came upon the village set to`destroy it. Caprin killed off`what resistance the village`had to offer and then`gathered around the shine to`Erollisi Marr, the elderly,`the women, and the children,`who were too weak to defend`themselves from the dark`knight. Carprin then set to`systematically desecrating`the temple by performing a`dark sacrifice on its altar.`After the sacrifice he`infected the rest of the`survivors with an incurable`malady that left them slowly`wasting away and dying.`When Bertoxxulous saw all`that his servant did in his`name he was pleased and`raised him to new and untold`levels of power. It was not`long after that Caprin`Deatharn would join his`master in the Plane of`Disease.`	0
knodeadtime2	The Tale of Toluwon``In the Plains of Karana in`a time not so long ago, the`clergy of Karana erected a`small temple in honor of The`Rainkeeper.  Among those`present at the building of`this temple was Young`Toluwon, a promising cleric`that had recently been raised`up from the position of`Acolyte. Young Toluwon`was one of the most promising`clerics to come in years. He`had shown wisdom beyond`his years, mastered the`honored rituals of Karana`in a short time, and`performed the extremely`difficult Ritual of Thunder`and Lightning for the first`time in centuries.`However, all this was soon`to come to an end for Young`Toluwon for he had a`different path to walk.``Young Toluwon returned home`soon after helping finish up`the final building stages of`the temple. He had to visit`his love in the nearby city`of Qeynos. When he arrived at`his lover's house, he found a`small note asking him to meet`her at a private locale.`Concerned, Toluwon made his`way immediately to the`locale, to find something he`could not believe. His lover`was a worshipper of the dark`god Bertoxxulous. She was`with a group of people in`brown robes muttering chants`to the Lord of Decay. Once he`overcame his disbelief he`knew what he must do. He`would join her, for she was`more important to him than`anything else.``When the decision was made,`the worshipers of`Bertoxxulous immediately sent`Toluwon out to prove his`faith. They sent him against`his old brethren at the newly`built temple in the Plains of`Karana. When he arrived the`priests were surprised to see`him back so early for they`knew he loved his woman`dearly. He assured them`everything was all right, and`told them that he needed to`get some rest. Little did`they know what dark plans`were about to unfold. In the`dead of night Toluwon crept`around and slit the throats`of each priest within the`temple. Then performing a`dark ritual told to him by`the priests of Bertoxxulous`he desecrated the newly`erected temple. Toluwon had`now become a full-fledged`member of Bertoxxulous'`clergy. This is how Bishop`Toluwon came to join the`legions of corruption.````Rise of Avhi Escron``Thousands of years ago in`lands long gone there was a`prophecy of power. It said`'One shall be born perched`between light and darkness.`They will grow and one day`shroud the world in golden`light or encompassing`darkness. For they will`choose.'  Avhi Escron was`born shortly thereafter. She`was the child foretold in the`prophecy and the forces of`light and dark waged war over`her.  As time passed Avhi`began to show signs of`extreme magical power,`unmatched by any ever known`to the world. The time for`her to choose was fast`approaching.``As the time came upon her`Avhi was tempted by the`forces of dark with images`of unseen power, wealth`beyond imagining, and`endless lands to rule.`With these images in her`mind, Avhi chose the side`of evil, and the world fell`into an encompassing`darkness.`The ancient evil, known today`as Bertoxxulous, was among`the powers that she now`served.``Decay and corruption became`a daily part of Avhi's life`as she explored the dark arts`of necromancy, creating new`dark rituals, and spells`became commonplace as she`reached the pinnacle of her`power. Eventually Avhi`declared herself fully in the`service of the Lord of Decay.`Soon after she brought down`a mighty spell of foul`corruption upon the kingdoms,`laying waste to huge tracts`of land.  And so Avhi`continued until one day she`was raised to the side of her`lord in the Plane of Disease.`	0
knodeadtime3	Fall of the Wemmal`Royal Family``The Wemmal Family had ruled`their small island in the`middle of the endless sea for`years.  Not knowing of the`other continents and lands of`their world, it was a`self-contained island filled`with peace. One day that`changed, for chance brought`the sole survivor of a`shipwreck to a beach on their`land. The survivor was`Banford Paffa a cook`from a pirate ship that`had been wrecked in a`nasty storm. The islanders`discovered him on one of the`beautiful beaches and brought`him to the royal family.``The Wemmal's were taken`with this seemingly charming`pirate from lands unknown.`They offered him a position`on the cooking staff for he`knew many exotic dishes`previously unknown to the`islanders.  However, the`Wemmal's would soon learn`that their new cook had a`dark secret. Banford was a`worshipper of Bertoxxulous,`the Lord of Decay. He set to`slowly poisoning the food`he served to the royal`family.  Soon after all of`the royal family became sick`and dying.  It was discovered`that Banford had been`poisoning them, but by then`it was to late, and the`Wemmals were dead. The`islanders maddened by grief`for their beloved royals`lynched Banford and hung`his corpse from the islands`tallest tree. Bertoxxulous`pleased with what Banford`accomplished gave him a new`form in the Plane of Disease,`where he now serves his lord`for eternity.```Origins of the Bubonians``In the deepest depths of some`forgotten tomb, Tarkon Praez,`a necromancer in service to`Bertoxxulous, was performing`experiments on a tribe of rat`men that he had previously`enslaved. During this time he`bred a variety of rat men,`but none of them were what`he wanted. Tarkon wanted a`ravenous, festering, and foul`breed that would strike`terror and fear into the`hearts of the pure. Tarkon`decided to pray one day to`his dark god for guidance.``After many hours of prayers,`foul rituals and sacrifices,`Bertoxxulous enlightened`Tarkon with a vision of what`he must do. He would travel`to the farthest reaches and`find the necessary`components to perform`a ritual of the darkest evil.`The four components`Tarkon was to gather were`a unicorn heart, tail of a`phoenix, tears of a virgin,`and the blood of a faerie.`After many trials and`tribulations he had gathered`the necessary components`and began the dark ritual.`What took form was more`than he expected. An`extremely evil crazed race`of rat men that carried a`foul plague in their blood`and minds. He dubbed them`the Bubonians and set them`on the land.``The Bubonians tore apart the`lands near the tomb of their`creation, spreading disease,`death, and destruction`wherever they went. They`continued unhindered for a`time, until they were`banished from the world by`a good and noble order of`knights. Bertoxxulous took`the Bubonians into the Crypt`of Decay and that is where`they have festered ever`since, waiting to lay waste`to the world once again.`	0
knohole1	Ognit Eznertob, Dabner`Drednever and Dagda Icefury`had spent the last several`days spelunking in the Hole`and the ruins of the old city`of Paineel. The ruins were`an eerie, dusty and dark`place. Strange and terrifying`sounds echoed throughout`the once splendorous city,`like wails of torment from`souls suffering in eternal`agony. Though Ognit seemed`unfazed by the atmosphere,`Dabner and Dagda were very`skittish about their journey`down into the Hole.``Dabner swore that the sounds`were none other than the`ghosts of Erudites slain`during the great war that`destroyed the old city years`ago. Ognit hypothesized that`the strange noises were`caused by undercurrents of`wind wafting from the surface`above and were nothing to be`concerned about. Dagda knew`not the cause of the sounds`but she was sure that the`three of them should not be`in that place. ``After spending some time`exploring the ruins and`wandering deeper into the`cavern, the three came across`the very thing for which`Ognit had been searching.`Before them stood The Hatch`and the wall of Living Stone.`The Living Stone is an`artifact of great power`created by Brell Serilis the`purpose of which was to stop`the creatures from the Plane`of the Underfoot from`entering into the world. The`residents of the old city`once conducted experiments`on the Living Stone,`attempting to find a way to`harness its power. The`experiments damaged the wall`of Living Stone and creatures`began to breach the wall and`threatened the city. The`Erudites constructed The`Hatch, a sort of life support`system that kept the Living`Stone strong after the`earthen Lord Yael escaped`and threatened their`destruction with his army`of elementals.``Ognit sought to study both`The Hatch and the wall of`Living Stone. He felt that`the Erudites were simply not`qualified for that sort of`study and indeed it would`take the delicate and careful`touch of a gnome to properly`study the artifact and`perhaps find a way to harness`its power. History has a way`of repeating itself.``Ognit considered the first of`his experiments successful.`He found that the wall of`Living Stone was able to`release enormous amounts`of power, as evidenced by`the tremendous earthquakes`he was able to cause simply`by infusing the Hatch with`just a small amount of`magical energy. Indeed, it`seemed the two worked`together like a transformer,`turning small amounts of`energy into tremendous`surges of power. Though he`had no idea how one could`harness the released energy,`he was impressed with the`results nonetheless.``Dagda was terrified and`believed that the gnome was`tinkering with powers beyond`his comprehension. She`threatened to leave them both`down there, particularly when`the experiments began to`cause earthquakes of greater`and greater magnitude.`Against her better judgement,`she stayed. ``Ognit saw the greater`earthquakes as a sign that`his experiments were going`well. He was getting even`better power output for the`same amount of energy.`Dabner eventually began`to become frightened too`and started to side with`Dagda, urging the wizard`to abandon the experiment.`Ognit was incensed and`no amount of convincing`would deter him from`his experimentation.`	0
knohole2	Finally, the inevitable`happened. Ognit channeled`just a small amount of energy`into the Hatch. It wasn't`much, not even enough to kill`a moss snake. However this`time, the Living Wall began`to shudder spasmodically and`took on a pale, sickly color.`The earthquake that resulted`was truly terrifying. Chunks`of stone began falling from`the ceiling and the ground`itself began to be ripped`apart. From the huge gashes`in the earth, the three saw`terrifying creatures emerge.`All about them were sounds`of shrieking, crying and`bellowing. The noises were`both exclamations of`excitement for finally being`freed and rage for being`imprisoned for such a long`time. The three began to flee`the hole in terror as the`creatures began to swarm`around them, their ears`ringing from the unholy`screams. ``As they made haste toward`the surface, they came across`a figure that looked to be an`Erudite. The Erudite was`walking slowly and limping`slightly. He was filthy,`covered with dirt and soot.`His skin was pallid, as one`who had not stood under the`glare of harsh sunlight for`ages. He wore a robe that was`a splotchy brownish color.`It was difficult to tell if`this was the robe's original`color or if it was the result`of the filth that covered it. ``He turned quickly and upon`seeing them, he spoke.`"Gnomes, and a Barbarian`woman of all things! I don't`know whether I should thank`you or draw the full sum of`the life-force from your`bodies right here and now!"``Dagda pushed her way past`the two gnomes, putting`herself between them and the`Erudite. Facing the strange`man she asked, "Who are you?"``He folded his arms across`his chest and smiled`slightly. He raised an`eyebrow as he spoke, "My`name is Dartain of the Dark`Truth. I don't suppose you`have any idea about what`you have just done? Or`perhaps I should say undone,`do you?" ``He seemed to stare through`their souls with eyes fierce`yet lined with weariness.`"Your meddling has caused`the Wall of Living Stone to`weaken once again. Though`your actions have finally`allowed me to break free`after being trapped for so`many a year, you have also`allowed many of the denizens`that were imprisoned behind`that wall to escape into the`world again as well."``Even in the dim light,`Ognit's face became visibly`paled. Dartain continued,`"The Hatch is still unharmed`and appears to be functioning`as it should. I believe the`wall will repair itself again`in time. While the breach`remains however, there will`be a steady flow of creatures`escaping from the underfoot.`I suggest you make haste out`of this place and take`warning to those above, so`that they may prepare`themselves."``As he finished speaking,`murky shadows made their`way from the floor and`encircled the dirty robes the`strange man wore. As he`disappear from view he softly`muttered, "Finally, I am`free."`	0
knohole3	The trio said not a word to`each other, and continued at`a dead sprint toward the`surface as the sound of an`army of creatures rumbled`directly behind them.`Reaching the top of the`ruins, they held their breath`as they jumped into the`cold water and wriggled their`way with panicked speed`through the rocky underwater`cavern that lead into the new`city of Paineel.``After emerging from the`water, the first breath they`took was used to issue forth`a scream of terror. All`around them, terrible`creatures of rock and stone`wandered in the open`throughout the streets of the`new city of Paineel. Already,`cries of alarm could be heard`being raised from deep within`the bowels of the city. Even`more alarming was the fact`that the earth still seemed`to be shaking, even after all`this time. ``Dagda in an effort to warn`the Heretics of the impending`danger shouted, "Horrible`creatures from the earth have`broken loose! Run for your`lives!"``Dabner exclaimed, "Brell`Serilis help us all! They are`everywhere!"``Dagda gave both gnomes a`shove forward and yelled,`"Go! Run!" The three began`at a dead run once again. She`kept behind the gnomes to`make sure they were both`still alive and running.``As he ran, Ognit smacked`himself in the forehead`screaming, "Oh gods! What`have I done! Just keep`running everyone!"``Guards Menbuknar and`Heridion stood near the`entrance to the new city`of Paineel. The pair of`skeletal sentries stood`staring out over the grassy`alcove through hollow eye`sockets that were long`without flesh or blood`watching over the new city`of Paineel in eternal service`to their Heretic masters. ``"Nooiiissseeey," Menbuknar`said with a quiet disembodied`voice like sandpaper in`response to the sudden`shouts.``Guard Heridion took several`steps forward and pointed,`"Rooockssss." Hefting their`swords above their head, the`two skeletal guards shambled`clumsily out into the`courtyard and began to fight`against the intruding earth`elementals.``As he swung away against`the creatures made from earth`itself, Menbuknar sniffed the`air with a nose that wasn't`there and rasped,`"Gnoommmessss."`	0
knohole4	Al'Kabor had been spending`his time researching in the`Qeynos area. Though he`preferred the superior`research facilities and`libraries of Erudin, he found`the locals in the Qeynos area`more then eager to assist him`with trivial errands for a`trifling handful of coins.`Indeed, labor was cheap and`the people generally hard`working and honest in this`law abiding town.``One such errand runner, a`half elf, had just returned`carrying a vial full of a`certain rare and difficult to`obtain ink he was sent to`fetch. He flipped the half`elf a gold piece and said,`"You are dismissed". The`errand boy looked at the`coin, smiled and then left`Al'Kabor's flat happily.``The ink was needed for a`scroll he was nearly finished`scribing. He had run out of`the rare and precious ink`just before he had completed`his work on the scroll. He`very carefully uncorked the`bottle and set it upon the`fine table of marble. Gently`unrolling the precious`scroll, he smoothed it`lovingly out on the cool`surface of the stone table.`He dipped the quill, made`from an enormous griffon`feather, into the ink. He put`the pen to the parchment`and began to once again`scribe the ancient runic`symbols onto the parchment`with slow and deliberate`care.``It started lightly, almost`imperceptibly. He first`thought that perhaps a mob`of angry people were stomping`up the stairs to his flat.`But suddenly, everything was`shaking violently. Books`began to fall from their`shelves, fine glassware fell`to the ground and smashed.`Gripping the heavy marble`table to keep his balance,`Al'Kabor watched in horror`as the bottle of very`expensive and difficult to`acquire ink rocked back and`forth, rolled on its side for`a moment and then tipped`over. Frozen in shock, he`watched as the ink spread`out over the scroll. ``He slammed his fist onto the`table as the realization`dawned upon him, "Five days`of work and components worth`a mountain of platinum`pieces, ruined by yet another`one of these damned`earthquakes!" He grabbed the`ruined scroll he had been`laboring upon for nearly a`week, crumpled it up in his`hand and tossed it out his`window. ``In crumpling the scroll, he`had inadvertently covered his`hands with the ink. Another`earthquake hit, this one more`violent then the last.`Stumbling a bit, he caught`himself on his coat rack in`the corner of his study. The`ink on his hands smeared`onto the robe that hung upon`the rack. Throwing his hands`into the air he shouted,`"I've had enough!" He wiped`his hands clean on the old`robe and threw it out the`window too. Putting his best`robe over his shoulders, he`stomped downstairs out of`his flat and into the streets`of Qeynos.` `Tramping through the streets,`he shouted, "How can anyone`get any work done around here`with all these earthquakes?`This is completely`unacceptable!" All around`him, people were running and`shouts of alarm filled the`streets. Walking toward the`gates of the city, he was`oblivious to the broken glass`on the ground and cracks in`the fine stone masonry, all`evidence of the quake's`severity.``Enraged, he grabbed a wood`elf by the lapels as he tried`to run past and yelled in his`face, "You! Elf! What is`causing these earthquakes?`Hmm?" The elf looked back`at him in fear and said`nothing. "Oh why do I bother`talking to one of your kind!"`Releasing him, the elf ran`away.``Stepping through the city`gates, he turned and inquired`indignantly to the heavily`armored Paladin next to him,`"How am I supposed to think`when every five minutes I`have the full contents of my`library on the floor, woman?"`The Paladin gave him a`sideways look, apparently`offended, snorted to herself`and then walked back into`the city shaking her head. ``"Bah," he said making a`dismissive gesture behind the`woman as she left. He began`walking down the path out of`the city. The stones that`made up the path were`uneven, some raised up`higher then others, no`doubt due to the earthquake.`"They should get`someone to fix this,"`Al'Kabor muttered to himself. `	0
knohole5	Suddenly, Al'Kabor found his`feet had sunk into the ground`a good foot or so and he was`unable to walk. Surrounding`him on four sides were small`creatures that appeared to be`made of earth itself. They`grabbed at his robes and`began pummeling him with`their fists of rock and dirt.``Without even thinking,`blinded by the sheer audacity`of these creatures to even`dare assault the mighty`Al'Kabor and dirty his best`robe, he begun to summon`forth the magical energy to`unleash his wrath upon these`creatures. The small`elementals, standing no`taller then the shortest`halfling, were each blasted`to bits by the sheer power of`the energy released in all`directions by the mighty`wizard. Clods of dirt and`pebbles flying through the`air were the only evidence`that the creatures were even`there a moment before.``"Why are these elementals all`over the place?" He pulled`his feet free from the ground`and walked over to a cleric`of Rodcet Nife who was`tending to another victim of`the elemental attack who`faired far worse then the`wizard. He asked, "You!`Cleric! Did these elementals`rise from the ground or did`somebody summon all of`these?"``The cleric finished`bandaging the wounded`traveler and said hurriedly,`"Sir, I have no idea. Excuse`me, many are hurt or in peril`from this attack. I must take`my leave."``Al'Kabor shouted to no one`in particular, "Bah! I'd`gather more information from`a wall then I would from you`people!" He continued to walk`up the stone path. Here and`there earth elementals were`assaulting folks outside the`city in the hills of Qeynos.`The Jagged Pine Treefolk`from Surefall Glade were on`full alert. The rangers and`druids that called the glade`home were doing their best`to stem the tide of the`elemental invasion.``Wandering the hills, Al'Kabor`walked about blasting any`elemental he came across to`kingdom come. He did this not`in defense of the hills nor`for any sort of loyalty to`the fine city of Qeynos but`more in retaliation for his`days of lost work and as`therapy for the general`feeling of rage and`displeasure he was`experiencing. Today was`not a good day at all and`it was about to get much`worse.`	0
knohole6	Al'Kabor was furious. He had`lost nearly a week of hard`work, lost research`components that were`expensive and difficult to`find, had one of his favorite`robes ruined and was`assaulted by a gang of small`upstart earth elementals. His`day was not going well and`was about to get worse.``He took a walk to the hills`outside of the city of Qeynos`as the elemental attack raged`on and minor aftershocks from`the huge quake rattled the`lands. He annihilated any of`the earthen beasts he came`across. He did this not in`defense of the hills nor for`any sort of loyalty to Qeynos`but more in retaliation for`his days of lost work and as`therapy for the general`feeling of rage and`displeasure he was`experiencing that day.``In the distance he heard`people calling out his name.`"Good, perhaps now I will`have some answers," he`thought to himself. Walking`back toward the city he saw`a crowd of people running`quickly toward him.``"Al'Kabor! There are two`gnomes and a barbarian`woman that are looking`for you. They said it is`very important," they`told him.``Al'Kabor muttered, "Them.`It figures." Then loudly he`said, "Very well. Take me to`them," he made a shooing`gesture with his hands, as if`to push the commoners along.``He followed the crowd back`to the gates of Qeynos. There`he saw the barbarian warrior,`Dagda Icefury. With her were`the gnomes, Ognit Eznertob`and Dabner Drednever. Upon`laying eyes upon the wizard,`they ran right up to him.`Their voices were panicked`and they were all talking at`the same time. It was`impossible to tell who was`saying what and why they`were so upset.``"Al'Kabor!"``"We have terrible news!"``"Odus is in danger!"``"There was this wall and`things from the ground and.."``"Something went wrong!"``"I didn't mean to do it!"``"They were everywhere! It`was terrible and.." ``Al'Kabor said, "One at a`time please." He waited and`still their frantic raving`continued. Finally he`screamed as loudly as he`possibly could, "Quit talking`all at once!!!"``The three stopped suddenly.`The wizard Ognit spoke.`"I'll tell him. This was all`my fault anyway."``Rolling his eyes Al'Kabor`said, "Speak then, gnome."``Ognit began, "Well, we were`all down in the ruins of Old`Paineel. In the Hole. And you`remember that Wall of Living`Flesh that is way down there?`Looks like a big face, you`know?"``Al'Kabor balled his fists at`his side. "Fool. Tell me that`you were not meddling with`The Wall!"``Ognit smiled sheepishly and`continued, "Well yes.`Actually I was to tell you`the truth. I came across some`writings that told of how`your ancestors were trying to`find a way to harness the`power of that artifact and I`thought that I would try to`continue that research."``Al'Kabor spat, "Ingrate! My`ancestors were not Heretics!`I've slew hundreds of those`fools during the Great War so`many years ago!" He glared`at Ognit, his eyes flashing`with a hideous fury, "You are`no better then they it`seems!"``Al'Kabor's hands began`glowing with a deep red color`and the sudden updraft of`wind that swirled around them`revealed the immensity of the`power the wizard had at his`disposal. The hairs on the`back of Ognit's neck stood`on end as the energy began`to course and build around`him. Ognit winced, expecting`to be blasted to bits. `	0
knohole7	Al'Kabor took a deep breath`and the energy that was`gathered from the sheer rage`of the mighty wizard`dissipated. "Fool! Continue."`Dagda turned a worried gaze`upon the wizard, her hand`slowly moving to her sword,`just in case. ``Dabner fidgeted nervously,`shuffling his feet and`wringing his gnomish hands.`"Wow Al, you're really mad`about this aren't you."``Ignoring the last few`stressful moments completely`Ognit said, "Ehem, yes. So`anyway, I found that if I`infused that Hatch thing`that's attached to the wall`with just the tiniest bit of`magical energy it would act`like a transformer and`release HUGE amounts of`power!"``Al'Kabor clenched both of`his fists and relaxed them`once again. "For your`information gnome, that Hatch`'thing' you speak of was put`in place to protect the Wall`of Living Stone and to keep`it alive and healthy!"``Al'Kabor continued, "The`Heretics damaged the wall of`Living Stone by trying to do`the very same experiments!`After they damaged it they`put the Hatch in place to`keep the wall alive and`strong. The Hatch and the`Wall of Living Stone prevent`the creatures that inhabit`the Plane of Underfoot from`entering the world ever`again. Your meddling has`obviously weakened both."``Ognit nodded and said, "Well`yes, of course. My`experiments were going really`well and I managed to get an`amazing power output on my`last attempt. That's when`things turned badly."``Al'Kabor put the back of his`hand to his forehead and`asked in a tired voice, "So`you damaged the Living Stone,`weakened the Hatch and`suddenly you were surrounded`by denizens of the underfoot`breaking loose and running`pell-mell to the surface`correct?"``"Well, that's about right,"`Ognit answered.``"No doubt those creatures`were all waiting with baited`breath for the moment the`wall would be weakened`sufficiently allowing for`their escape again. I'm sure`they were alerted the moment`you've begun this madness,"`the wizard hypothesized.``Dabner raised his hand. The`diminutive cleric of Brell`Serillis said, "Ognit, tell`him about that Dartain guy.`He seemed pretty nice, except`for that bit about draining`our life force and stuff."``Al'Kabor turned a murderous`glare upon the gnome, "Gods`strike me dead now!" His`voice dripping with sarcasm`and spite he ordered, "Yes`Ognit, please tell me about`Dartain!"``A rather large crowd of`people had gathered around`the group and were listening`intently to the discussion.`One person in particular,`another Erudite, seemed very`interested in what was being`discussed. So interested in`fact, that he was writing`furiously in a small booklet`apparently recording every`word that was said.``Ognit said nervously, "Yes,`well, this Dartain fellow`was an Erudite, like you."``Noticing the anger of`Al'Kabor building again upon`the comparison, Ognit`corrected himself. "No! I`take that back! He was`nothing like you actually.`Not like you, uhh, he was`kind of spooky though. Not`like you're not scary`yourself."``Ognit stopped and`stammered, "Umm. I didn't`mean that like it sounded.`Let me start over. Ok, so`this Dartain guy was an`Erudite." Al'Kabor took`in breath as the name`was repeated and his teeth`ground audibly.``Ognit laughed nervously and`then said, "Yes. So he said`he was trapped for a long`time in the Plane of`Underfoot but he seemed`really happy to finally be`out of there. On the bright`side, he told me that The`Living Wall would heal itself`in time. And he said that The`Hatch was still functioning`properly. So everything`should be ok." ``Ognit smiled, "You see, no`harm done! A few days and`everything should be back to`normal!" `	0
knohole8	Al'Kabor was utterly silent`and his face expressionless.`A slight twitch in the corner`of his mouth was his only`movement.``Ognit asked, "Al'Kabor?"``Al'Kabor raised his fist, his`eyes flashing in murderous`rage as he looked upon the`gnome, "Now I shall end your`miserable gnomish life!" Wind`charged with electricity`seemed to blow directly up`from the ground itself and`enveloped the crowd as the`wizards hands began to glow`with sheer power. People`began to take a few tentative`steps backward.``At those words, the Erudite`that was writing quickly put`his book in his vest pocket`and interposed himself`between the gnome and`Al'Kabor. The Erudite`shouted, "Stay your hand`wizard! I shall take it from`here!"``The wind subsided as the`energy drained away`harmlessly. Al'Kabor`recognized the man that`shouted and he smiled to`himself. Ognit saw that it`wasn't a good smile. It was`a smile that told him that it`may have been better to have`been blasted to bits.``The man identified himself,`"I am Warden Lius of Erudin.`I have been following these`three since this catastrophe`began!" He turned to the`gnome and said in a`commanding voice, "Ognit`Eznertob! You are hereby`under arrest for the crime of`treason! You have imperiled`the continent of Odus and`have released unto the world`a heinous criminal, the`heretic of old Dartain!"``The Warden bound Ognit's`hands and feet in heavy`chains. "I doubt that there`will be need for a trial. By`your own admission made`here this day, it is evident`that you are guilty. Surely`it will be 'The Hollowing'`for you." Pushing the gnome`roughly he commanded, "Move`along criminal!"``As Ognit was led away, Dagda`was surprised to find tears`falling from her face. She`knew that Ognit was guilty,`yet she was not sure if`execution was the just course`of punishment in this`situation. As a follower of`The Tribunal, she was torn`between her notions of`justice and her loyalty and`vow to protect her two`gnomish friends. Indeed, she`would rather that it was she`who was being led away. At`least she may have had the`strength to break free and`perhaps escape. She knew`that the physically weak`gnome would have no`such chance and given`that the Erudites are the`most experienced and`schooled in the use of magic,`she had no doubt that they`would take every precaution`to prevent his casting any`spell. She felt truly`hopeless.`	0
knohole9	Dagda wiped her eyes and`brought herself up to her`full height. She asked`Al'Kabor, "Who is this`Dartain?"``Al'Kabor answered, "Dartain`is one of the heretics. A`heretic of old. He was among`those that put The Hatch in`place to repair the Wall of`Living Stone. Through his`own misfortune, he managed`to get sealed on the other`side of the wall in the`Underfoot, while his`companions were slaughtered`to a man. He was able to`complete the ritual from the`Underfoot side and The Hatch`was put in place`successfully. The Underfoot`was sealed off from the rest`of the world and the danger`ended. Everyone assumed he`was dead afterward, of`course."``Dagda looked confused and`stated, "He is certainly not`dead. We saw him this day`with our very eyes. Though`he appeared pale and weak, I`know that hot blood filled`his veins. By what magic is`he still alive after all this`time?"``Al'Kabor looked up for a`moment thoughtfully. He then`hypothesized, "The Altered`Planes are much different`from our world here. It is`indeed possible that by`virtue of the elder magics`that course throughout all`of the Underfoot and the`other Planes, that mortals`age differently there." ``Then he added, more to`himself then to anyone else,`"No doubt the Heretics will`gain in strength with his`release and I will not stand`idly by while this happens.`I must go and prepare. I can`not allow Dartain to remain`in this realm while I draw`breath."``Al'Kabor stopped for a`moment and stroking his chin`reflectively said, "Perhaps`some good will come of this.`Maybe the denizens of the`Underfoot will finally`destroy the heretics in`Paineel before The Living`Wall is able to heal itself."`He then walked away back`through the city gates.``Dabner grabbed Dagda by the`hand and cried, "Oh Dagda,`what are we going to do? What`about Ognit and Odus and`Dartain and everything!"``Dagda was numb. "I don't`know Dabner. I am at a loss`and I can not think." Dagda`began to walk into Qeynos`through the gates leaving`Dabner behind. Her sword`hung limply in her hand.``"Dagda! Where are you`going," he asked running`after her.``She turned and facing him`said, "I am returning to`Toxxulia forest. I intend to`fight the beasts from the`earth and to try to keep`them at bay until that wall`is able to repair itself.`Perhaps some combat will`help to clear my head."`Together both entered the`city, making a beeline for`the docks to book passage`to the continent of Odus.`	0
knokithbat1	All throughout Antonica,`forces were being prepared`for war. Quartermasters`scrambled to equip hastily`recruited  troops. Men both`military and  mundane trained`and practiced  diligently on`both sides for  what would`surely be a most  terrible`war. Anyone who could`carry a weapon, carried one `during those days for none`knew when the army of dark`elves would advance.``The Teir'Dal likewise`prepared. They were confident`that they would be`successful. Indeed, they `had the blessing of Innoruuk`and his very daughter Lanys`T'Vyl to lead them. Together`with her mentor Laarthik`K'Shin, the two would lead`their great army against the`forces of High Keep further`increasing the strength of`the nation of Teir'Dal and`dividing the two cities`Qeynos and Freeport, setting`up a stranglehold upon the`races of light.``The morning was rainy and`cold when the dark elves`began  their march. Lead by`Laarthik K'Shin and Lanys`T'Vyl, the hordes of Teir'Dal`were a consuming fire upon`the common lands. Platoons`of Teir'Dal broke off to`crush the rag-tag bands of`allied forces that rose to`stop their advance.`Regardless of the opposition`they faced, Lanys and`Laarthik pushed forward`toward their goal.`All around  the sounds of`war rang out, metal against`metal, battle cries and`screams of the dying.``As the army approached`Kithicor forest, a rear guard`was left behind to prevent`the advancement of any of the`races of light through the`common lands. It was then`that the army began to`splinter and spread`throughout Kithicor forest`like a goblet of wine spilled`upon a table. Slinking`through the forest, a group`of 30 Teir'Dal crept into`Rivervale. They struck`quickly and the peaceful`halfling city was occupied`and subjugated under the`brutal heel of the dark elven`oppressors with little or to`no resistance. The Teir'Dal`raided the shops and took`whatever meager wealth the`halflings had. Any who`protested were quickly struck`down by the new rulers of`Rivervale.``As the army continued to work`its way through the forest,`they began to meet with`heavier resistance as the `allied races of light sprang`forth from their hiding`places and ambushed the`Dark Elves. Battles began`to erupt in every corner`of the forest. As quickly`as a Teir'Dal was struck`down, another would come`forward to take its place.`As soon as a Teir'Dal`platoon would survive one`ambush, they would be`ambushed yet again.`Both armies were relentless.`Neither side could tell who`was winning. The smell of`death and of blood began to`replace the usually fragrant`smells of the forest.``Lord Tephys, Galeth Veredeth`and Firiona Vie waited just`outside the entrance to High`Pass with the assembled`forces of the Paladins of`Tunare and all others that`were willing to assist them.`The situation was very grave.`The armies approach was`heralded by a stampede of`frightened animals all`scurrying in fear of the`approaching dark elven`menace. It was shortly`thereafter that they began to`hear the sound of marching`boots, the clang of weapons,`and the rattle of armor`peppered with the occasional`scream approaching through`the forest.`	0
knokithbat2	It was there, near the`entrance to High Pass that`the leaders of the two armies`met, face to face. The forest`seemed to groan and the very`earth trembled. Cruel`laughter was heard echoing`through the trees.``Lord Tephys raised his mailed`fist into the air and swore`aloud, "By the grace of The`Mother, you will be stopped`Child of Hate! Your cursed`army shall go no farther then`where I stand."``Lanys's derisive laughter`seemed supernaturally loud`as it rang out, almost`hurting the ears of those`around her, "Old fool, you`feel such hate for me and`in that I am glad. This`only proves the strength`of my father and his power!`However, the hate you feel`toward me is nothing`compared to the sheer`depths of hate I hold`toward you and your kind.`Prepare to feel the full`force of the power that is`hate itself!"``And with those words, the two`armies clashed. Lanys`seemed to close the gap`between herself and Lord`Tephys in but a single`leap and struck at the old`Paladin with a viscous`fury. Like a hammer unto`an anvil, Lanys's swords`struck again and again`against the upraised shield`of Lord Tephys. The Paladin`struggled valiantly under the`harsh blows of the Child of`Hate. The attacks were`relentless and only seemed to`become more violent as they`continued.``Finally, the shield of the`old Paladin failed him and`Lanys landed a blow squarely`upon the aged shoulder of the`holy fighter. Dropping his`shield, he staggered backward`but clutching his wound as it`bled freely he whispered for`aid from Tunare. His hand`glowed a soft blue as the`wound healed and he smiled`to himself as he felt the love`of The Mother. His smile`quickly faded as he looked up`to see Lanys's hands glowing`as well, a cruel smile upon`her face.``Shouting out words in Ancient`Teir'Dal, Lanys made a`sweeping gesture toward her`enemy, great streams of`magical energy coursing from`her outstretched hands and`enveloping the High Elf.`Lord Tephys clutched at his`chest as his whole body was`wracked with incredible pain.`Stunned from the sudden and`unexpected blow, Lord Tephys`failed to block as Lanys`struck a final terrible blow.`Lord Tephys fell quietly to`the ground and into the bosom`of the Great Mother.``Meanwhile, a much different`battle was being waged. Two`seasoned fighters, leaders of`men, both ancient and both`veterans of countless battles`squared off against each`other. Like a deadly game of`chess, Laarthik K'Shin and`Galeth Veredeth circled one`another in a deadly ballet of`thrusts and parries. Both`were opponents of equal skill`but Laarthik, through the`dark power he practiced, had`the body of a young man.`Galeth on the other hand,`though in excellent physical`shape for his age, was still`very old.``Lowering his guard ever so`slightly, Laarthik allowed`Galeth to bash him square in`the chin with his shield.`Striking like a serpent,`Laarthik's hand shot forward`enveloped in a blaze of fiery`magical energy. Stepping`inward and snaking his`blazing hand under the`upraised arm of the High`Paladin's shield, Laarthik`touched the chest of the`Galeth as the fire left the`hand of the Teir Dal and`enveloped his mortal enemy.``A cry of shock and pain`erupted from the lips of the`elder fighter. But with a`speed that one would not`expect from an old man he`quickly jumped back and`laying his hand upon his`blistered and still smoldering`skin, the wound disappeared`completely though the smell`of burning flesh was still`heavy in the air.``Galeth smiled briefly at his`mortal enemy and laughed, "It`appears we are still even my`worthy adversary." Then`feigning surprise, he raised`his eyebrows and taunted, "Oh`wait, I see your lip is`bleeding now! Perhaps it is I`who have the upper hand!"`They resumed their deadly`dance.`	0

She did not`forget the training she`received from her mentor`Galeth. She realized the`importance of remaining calm`and level headed during`combat. Firiona and Lanys`were polar opposites on the`field of combat. Lanys foamed`at the mouth and struck`viscously while Firiona was`calm, almost relaxed, as she`turned aside her blows.`Biding her time and saving`her strength, Firiona simply`parried the blows of Lanys`T'Vyl.``Laarthik and Galeth continued`their deadly ballet. The body`that housed Laarthik's evil`soul was young and strong but`Galeth's old body was growing`weak. Little by little, he`felt himself loosing his`edge. He began to realize,`that this was a battle that`he could not win. He resolved`himself to hold off Laarthik`for as long as possible,`regardless of the outcome.``As Lanys's attack continued`against Firiona, the Chosen`of Tunare noticed the fury`begin to fade just a bit from`the dark elf's strikes. In a`single fluid motion, the`Paladin parried both of her`opponents blades downward`with her single sword as she`circled swiftly to the side`of Lanys. Swinging her shield`in a back handed motion as`she spun, she struck Lanys`brutally in the back of the`head, pushing her off balance`momentarily.``Though surprised and`momentarily dazed by the`sudden attack, Lanys regained`her composure in time to turn`aside the deadly sword thrust`that was aimed directly for`her midsection. It was from`this point forth, that`Firiona took the offensive.`This time it was she who`struck again and again, with`Lanys continually backing up`under the force of her blows.``Swarms of tiny insects began`to swarm around the battle`and the ground began to`tremble at the Great Mother's`displeasure. Firiona seemed`to grow in stature and her`golden hair began to shine`brilliantly as she was filled`with the love of the Mother`and surrounded by her`protection. She waged her`battle against the chosen of`Innoruuk without mercy,`making known the full`displeasure of the Tunare.``Lanys was becoming weak`and faltered under the`righteous anger. Her eyes,`once a blaze of hate and`fury were now glazed and`filled with exhaustion.`Defending herself`grimly, she called out,`"Laarthik, please help me!"``Hearing the cry of help from`his student and the chosen of`his race and god, Laarthik`was filled with a new found`rage. Roaring like a lion, he`drove the pummel of his sword`straight across and onto the`temple of the tiring Galeth`Veredeth. The savage blow`was too much for the High`Paladin of Tunare. Galeth,`for the first time in his`long life, fell before an`opponent on the field of`battle, bleeding and`unconscious. ``Seeing the gravity of the`situation, Laarthik pulled`the large glowing blue sphere`found by the goblin Nurgal,`from out of his breastplate.`The orb glowing brightly,`pulsed and vibrated in`Laarthik's hands. The air`resonated and hummed with`energy. Holding the orb to`the sky, he cried out in a`strangled voice, "Innoruuk!`In the name of Lanys T'Vyl,`I beseech you! Attend her!"`The energy contained within`the orb was released.`	0
knokithbat4	The screams of ten thousand`damned souls filled the world`as an immeasurable power`opened a rift in the astral`barrier. The hearts of even`the most evil and twisted`creatures in Norrath were`suddenly filled with dread`and fear from the terrible`miasma of evil that spewed`forth from the Plane of Hate.``Laarthik's borrowed body was`encased in a pillar of fire`emanating from the orb, as`the energies of Innoruuk were`unleashed. Nothing can`withstand the presence of a`god and Laarthik's body was`quickly torn apart by the`terrible power.``Lanys tossed her head and`laughed throatily. She`shouted out in welcome to the`power of Innoruuk. Her body`glowed with crimson flame`as she was drawn upward by`the Prince of Hate, her`father. The Child of Hate`disappeared into the swirling`rift in the sky as the`remains of Laarthik crumpled`to the ground. A tremendous`roar rose up from the very`heart of Norrath.`Firiona Vie stared in dismay`and shock as Lanys was`swept into the Heart of Hate,`dread filling her eyes with`angry tears. The Chosen of`Tunare called out to those`around her as her heart`was overcome by terror,`"Flee!  Flee for your lives!`Doom approaches!"``Firiona rushed to Galeth's`side and cried, "This is a`portent of death! None can`survive the Hate Innoruuk`will cast upon us!" She`helped her fallen mentor`struggle to his feet and`together, they both fled the`scene of the calamity.``A vacuous wave of`hopelessness and dread`withered the souls of all in`Kithicor as sight was ripped`from their eyes from`Innoruuk's presence. Hearts`beating rapidly in fear`suddenly stopped. In an`instant, the terrible clamor`of war was replaced by an`unnatural silence. All life`in the forest, whether dark`elf, ally, or animal, was`instantly extinguished.``And so ended the Battle of`Bloody Kithicor. Both sides`suffered terrible losses. The`allied forces held what was`probably the most sober and`somber "victory" party in`history at High Pass. The`Dark Elves retreated to`Neriak. The once quiet,`sylvan forest that was filled`with relatively peaceful`woodland creatures had been`forever tainted. To this day,`Kithicor is haunted by the`restless souls of the fallen`soldiers that perished during`that terrible war. The world`was never the same again.`	0

This`haven of wildling beast-folk`was constructed in the`unknown past, concealed from`the keepers of Norrath's`history by the blessings of`chance. ``The Valley of the Dawn was`constructed before the time`of man, perhaps even before`the time of the elves. The`bestial-folk known as the`Tribes of the Dawn and Moon`took haven on the surface of`Norrath, comfortable and`nestled within the confines`of the dank, dark, and`strangely beautiful redwood`forest now known as the`Unkempt Wood. As the solar`and lunar tribes established`themselves as fierce warriors`and guardians of the natural`world that they revere as`sacred above all else, the`tribes built the Valley of`the Dawn - a complex and`beautiful subterranean`citadel dedicated to the laws`of the wild that these beings`protect. ``Within the first era of man,`when great civilizations and`cultures were still in the`far distance of time, a`nomadic tribe of humans`stumbled upon the redwood`forest. The Tribes of the`Dawn and the Moon were`curious, although they did`not interfere with the`humans' initial presence.`When the humans showed`themselves to be intelligent`beings that wished for`nothing other than their own`survival, the tribes`approached. ``It was the Gihjna that the`humans first encountered - `the ursine behemoths whom`represent the side of life`and creation in the cycle of`nature and comprised the`solar Tribe of the Dawn.`The gentle, although wary`Gihjna interacted with the`human tribe over the course`of a single year and in that`time, the Gihjna lent their`knowledge and beliefs to the`curious and eager humans.`The Lujien - wolf-like`creatures that embody`destruction, death, and the`inherent chaos of the wild`and comprise the lunar Tribe`of the Moon - never did show`themselves at this historic`moment, despite their shared`curiosity with their ursine`brethren.``The nomads settled within`the forest and adapted`themselves to the ways of`nature and the wild as the`Gihjna had taught them.`They were fledgling in their`beginnings as primordial`wardens of the wild,`although their magical gifts`were few and almost vulgar,`for all they had learned was`from the Gihjna, whose`spirits are more tightly`bound to the natural world`than any human or elf. `	0
knounkempt2	A generation would pass`before the elves of Tunaria`would find the majestic`redwood forest. When the`day arrived that a small`band of scouts from the`Elddar Forest found the`untouched beauty of this`rugged wilderness, the human`nomads reacted as the Gihjna`had greeted their ancestors'.`The elves were not receptive`to the warm welcome that the`humans extended, all but one`- an elven druid by the name`of Wegadas. He was curious`about the human settlers, and`even more curious to find`that there were no man-made`structures to deteriorate the`life force of the forest that`he felt so strongly. ``Wegadas accepted the`humans' hospitality and`despite the language barrier`separating them, Wegadas`quickly learned that these`humans lived in harmony`with the forest, and`likely had for some time.`Their intense geographic`knowledge of the region was`precise and what little bit`Wegadas had to observe, he`took note of the harmony in`which the humans shared`with their habitat. He was`reminded much of the`primordial elves - in the`times before Takish'Hiz`and the establishment`of the great empire his`people had come to be.``Wegadas' elven companions`were entranced with the dank,`gloomy treasure they had`found. They were lured by`the gentle song of the`forests' spirit, a song that`any elf's spirit would easily`hear, and bewitched by the`purity and strength of the`uncorrupted and untouched`spiritual life and strength`of the wood.``After a day of intense`scouting and brief`interaction with the peaceful`human tribe, the elves`reunited with their brother`and spoke of their need to`have this forest for the`Takish'Hiz Empire.`Wegadas spoke out`against his fellow elves,` he did not wish to drive`the humans from their`home, for they live with it`in a way parallel to the`elves' own cultural ways.`He felt that the humans`could be brought to the ways`of the elves and the forest`could, with the aid of the`Elven Empire, thrive on its`own and remain the pure,`emerald jewel of wilderness`that they stood within. There`was no need to reave this`home from the tribe, for they`lived only in harmony with`the wild and balance of`nature. ``The superior in the group,`a wanderer by the name of`Kuvriathan, objected to`Wegadas' argument and sent`the him back to Takish'Hiz`with instructions to report`their discovery. The druid`departed his party's side`obediently, but did not leave`the forest boundaries. ``The elves then tried to herd`the humans out of this forest`in attempt to cleanse it of`the tribal presence and the`taint they believed the`humans would inevitably`bring - for these elves had`seen the fledgling foundation`of the eastern costal cities`and knew the destruction`this race was capable of on a`whim. The wary Gihjna and`Lujien immediate interfered,`having watched the elves`since their arrival.`Unsuspecting of the fierce`and powerful guardians of the`woodland, the elves were`taken unaware. All but one`of the elven party were `destroyed - Wegadas. ``When the Lujien came for him,`he presented himself unarmed`and willingly, despite the`human pleas for him to go`and not incur the wrath of`the guardians that had`allowed them haven in the`woods. The Lujien halted`their advancement when`they saw the plight of their`accepted human guests to`spare the elf's life. ``It was their pack leader, an`elder Lujien warrior known`to the human tribe as`Udos-Ehai Digowa`(Fang of the Shadow in the`common tongue), that`approached Wegadas and`sunk his great maw into`the elf's shoulder, but did`not kill him. The Lujien`spoke in voiceless words`to the elf, a conversation`that would later be written`in the Writ of the Wild, a`sacred text that dictates`the history and code of`the Unkempt Warders. `	0
knounkempt3	Udos-Ehai Digowa`commanded the druid to`remain in the forest and`share with the humans his`magics and ways.`If ever the druid should`attempt to flee the`forest confines, the Tribe`of the Moon would kill him,`for they are always watching.`However, Wegadas was not to`corrupt the knowledge and`ways that the Gihjna had`taught the humans. Wegadas`agreed without argument and`the Lujien pack faded`silently into the shadows,`leaving the wounded elf to`the human tribe to fulfill`the demands that would`guarantee his continued life.``Wegadas learned the`language of the humans`to perfection in his`first fortnight. With`communication established,`Wegadas learned the ways`that the Gihjna had taught`the humans - finding them`intriguing and immediately`adapting them as his own`for sake of the people now`in his care and in respect to`the native bestial tribes`that spared his life. ``Over the first years, Wegadas`taught the human tribe the`ways of the wilderness - he`spoke to them of Tunare,`The Mother of All; the great`goddess of growth and nature.`He taught them how to pay`their respects to his own`goddess without prayer or`sacrifice - only that they`must respect the power of`the natural world, for as it`had given them life; it can`just as easily and without`warning take it from them.`This is a law that should be`neither feared nor hated but`one that is given the respect`of an inevitable reality and`one that cannot be altered`by steel or mind.``The humans clung to`Wegadas' liberal preaching`and lessons, embracing`the matron goddess of`growth as their own.`Soon thereafter, the`humans would learn the ways`of the druid - adapting and`wielding the magics that`Wegadas taught them, and`that they taught themselves`at an exceptional rate.`Rangers would be the first`of the master adepts,`however, for the magic within`them was less than their`druid compatriots and the`ferocity of the wild had`already been established in`their ways.``As the human tribe became`established, Udos-Ehai`Digowa and the Gihjna`elder, Etsi Agal-Iha`(Mother of the Light)`returned to the human`tribe. The tribes of the Dawn`and Moon established the`laws of the wild: none of`Wegadas' tribe was to`leave the forest, and if`they attempted to do so,`they would be killed.`They were children of`the wild now, and their`attempts to see the outside`world would corrupt them.`The Tribes of the Dawn and`Moon also established that`all who entered the forest`would be driven out or`destroyed at the discretion`of Wegadas and the tribe. ``The third law was that the`Lujien and Gihjna would`remain out of the human`tribe's affairs - so long as`they maintained the order the`Gihjna had given the`generations past, and that`they did not stray from`their duties to the forest`that has accepted them as its`children. ``The laws were agreed upon`with Wegadas' leadership, for`the human tribe trusted his`wisdom and guidance`explicitly. Satisfied, the`solar and lunar tribes`departed, although their eyes`never strayed from their`human guests.``It was in those first years`that Wegadas' intrigue with`the humans grew to tightly`woven kinship. Slowly, he`released his grip on his`elven life and embraced the`fledgling existence and`culture that he was`instrumental in fathering.`The elven druid was`Fier'Dal no more, his`brethren were no longer`human - they were`all children of the wild and`it was then that Wegadas`learned a true peace.``Finding his true purpose`and never longing for the`life he abandoned,`Wegadas would spend nearly`a century composing what`would become the most`revered and sacred of relics`to the homid tribe of the`redwood forest - the Writ of`the Wild. ``This sacred tome detailed`Wegadas' rebirth into the`wilderness per his own`perspective, as well as the`laws that he had established`and his people followed. The`tome also detailed the Lujien`and Gihjna culture and their`ancient tales and religion`that Wegadas had been privy`to in the several centuries`he dwelled among them.`	0
knounkempt4	Wegadas would find several`mates in his lifetime among`the human tribe and be father`to over a dozen children`- half elven children. The`last of his children and`only daughter would be named`Elaryness. ``Shortly after the birth of`his final child, nearly four`centuries after establishing`the Writ of the Wild and`guiding his brethren through`their newfound ways,`Wegadas was old and`weary and heard the`distinct call of the`forest - beckoning him to`fulfill his own cycle of`life. The old druid would`pass into the wilderness`forever at a site that would`later become the most sacred`site of the unkempt tribe.``Wegadas' body was not`buried, nor was it touched`by the wild creatures of`the forest. He is said to`have melded into the`earth, and from his`reclaimed flesh and spirit,`a great willow grew - the`Weeping Willow of Tunare.`The ancient tales of the`human tribe would say that`the willow was a gift to`Wegadas' children and`brethren from Tunare herself.`As she reclaimed his old`spirit, the Mother of All`felt the great loss that the`unkempt tribe suffered with`Wegadas' passing and`listened to their wordless`prayer as they said their`farewells to the beloved`leader. In her appreciation`for the human tribe's`devotion to her and in`honor of her missionary,`Wegadas, she molded his`spirit and essence into the`great, beautiful willow that`eternally weeps the tears of`joy and sorrow of the tribe.``With her father's passing`and the appearance of the`great willow, Elaryness, the`only daughter of Wegadas,`would rightfully challenge`four others - two of whom`were her half-brothers- who`had made the declaration for`leadership in Wegadas' stead.`The brutal, ceremonial`battles would last days at a`time, where those who vied`for leadership would hunt one`another throughout the whole`expanse of the woods.`Elaryness would destroy her`challengers and the tribe,`now beneath her rule, would`move their bodies to the very`location where Wegadas`himself had laid to final`rest. These brutal and`oftentimes savage hunts`(dictated by the hunters'`primordial instincts) are law`amongst the Unkempt`Warders, for it is the law`of the wild - the strongest`lead whilst the weakest`follow, though none are`whole without the other.``Elaryness would be declared`the first Hierophant of the`Unkempt Warders. It was also`Elaryness who would`establish the Shrine of`Tunare, in memory of`her father and to fulfill`the debt that she felt`her entire tribe owed to`the Mother of All for her`gift of Wegadas, and the`weeping willow.`	0
knounkempt5	For several more generations,`the Unkempt Warders would`flourish and hold true to`their vows to the Lujien and`Gihjna tribes. However, it`would be the settlement of`the Jaggedpine forest that`would render the peace and`harmonious existence of the`Unkempt to one of strife and`true ferocity to uphold their`promise and ways.`When human settlers`dedicated to the ways of`Karana established`themselves in the`Jaggedpine forest and began`to explore the surrounding`areas, the unkempt were`revealed to the rest of`Norrath in flurry of brutal`attacks upon any whom`entered their territory.`Eventually, the Jaggedpine`would seal off its entry`to the Unkempt Wood,`leaving the feral tribe to`its own - preserving their`own existence and maintaining`their ways.``For years after, the Unkempt`seemed to be again at peace.`They managed to convert`several of the Jaggedpine`settlers to their ways before`entry was impossible, as well`as few of the scarcely`wandering elves who`stumbled into the unkempt`territory as the years`passed both prior and`after Wegadas' death. ``Now, they are again in`unknown and unspoken`turmoil. The Writ of the`Wild, the sacred tome of`the Unkempt, has been`lost. Their ancient vows`to the Lujien and Gihjna`tribes prevent them from`seeking the tome beyond`the forest boundaries.`The better judgment of the`Gihjna elders lean away from`searching for material`possession - for the unkempt`know the tome by heart, and`they may continue its life`and purpose through voice`and lessons, as Wegadas had`originally intended. `	0
knounkempt6	-=}The Unkempt Druids{=-``Throughout the Plains of`Karana and the Mountains of`Rathe, very small bands of`human and half elven rangers`and druids have laid claim to`the unkempt ways. These`misguided few have recently`been introduced to the true`path of the unkempt with the`discovery of ancient scrolls`believed to be a part of the`missing tome bound in a`living weave of moss and`fern - the Writ of the Wild.``Few can decipher this tome's`ancient symbols, dating back`to the era when man was`nothing more than groups of`nomadic tribes wandering the`face of Norrath. The`ignorance of the tome's true`words and meaning had only`strengthened the thirst for`the truth of the unkempt ways`in these few outcast druids`and rangers of the wild. ``Eager to know what secrets`the tome would reveal, the`outcast druids of Rathe`Mountains sought the hermit`who dwells in his solitude in`the southern plains of`Karana. Believed to have`been schooled in the ways`of the true unkempt in the`Unkempt Wood long ago, the`hermit was able to translate`the fragmented pieces of`these ancient documents -`although he would lend only a`small portion of their`knowledge and secrets to the`curious outsiders. The hermit`gave the select translated`passages to the outcast`wildlings and sent them away`- the originals believed to`remain in his possession.``With only a minor portion of`the unkempt tome translation,`these outcasts began to`spread their passion for the`wild across all of Norrath,`looking to convert any child`of the natural world to their`cause. From the plains of`Karana to the misty forests`of the Faydark, the outcast`druids and rangers have`gained some support, forming`a small and sheltered cult`dedicated to the vague ways`of the unkempt path that they`have access to.``However, the ancient writs'`words and guidance were not`enough to show these curious`and passionate wildlings the`true meaning of what it is to`be unkempt. Their ignorance`may become their downfall,`for now they seek to uncover`the sacred Unkempt Wood`where the ways of the`unkempt were born.``The true followers of the`Writ of the Wild are those`known as Unkempt Warders,`who have not wandered`from their homeland of the`Unkempt Wood since their`founding. Little is known`by outsiders of the`Unkempt Warders, for they`are reclusive by nature and`do not seek to venture beyond`the boundaries of their`cherished and well-guarded`territory. `	0
knovahshir1	The Prophecy``Before the beginnings of`Kerran Civilization, each`Kerran roamed their own`territory as did the beasts`of the wild. Soon the lands`became too small to divide,`and so four of the`eldest Kerra journeyed to`the very top of the highest`peak in the Stonebrunt`Mountains to seek out more`land, one from each direction.``When they reached the top,`they met and began to speak`to one another. Kajek, the`first to arrive spoke first,`and he said "I am the first`to have found this peak. And`so the land is mine." Shir`the second to arrive and`largest of the four spoke`next, and he said "You are`the first, but there is no`more land, and so we will`fight. The victor shall take`this land" Karani and Shahar`were females and spoke as`one, and they said "We will`share this land with the`victor"``But Kajek was wise and he`said to the three "You say`there is no more land and so`we must fight. Perhaps the`spirits can show us if this`is indeed the last of the`land." And so they agreed.` Kajek made fire and called`to the spirits to show them`the truth. He chanted to the`spirits until night when the`moon came forth and Kajek`glanced to the skies and`placed his staff upon the`fire. The crystal stone`within his staff began to`glow and upon the moon the`image of Shir could be seen.`And Kajek spoke "Up there`lies land.  If you are truly`strong then that land is for`you and this is my land."`Shahar and Karani agreed "He`is right and we will share`this land with Kajek as the`spirits foretell."``Shir turned away his head as`if to leave. It was then that`the voice of the spirits`cried out. "You must share`the land until the journey to`the farthest land of the`nights sky can be made by`the children of the beast. It`is on this land that the`chosen ones will become the`warriors of the great spirit.`It is on this land that the`destiny of the chosen ones`shall be proclaimed."``The four nodded in`acknowledgement of the wise`spirits. Kajek howled to the`spirits "It will be so, but`it was Shir who had wished`to slay me. From this day his`kin must seek council with`the three that wish for`peace." The reply of the`spirit came forth "It shall`be so until the wise one`steps forth from the rocks`and the mist. It is then that`all shall be as one."``And so went the prophecy of`the Kerran. The lands were`divided among the four. Kajek`took the Stonebrunt to watch`the passing of the land and`learn. Shahar took the`fruitful plains to the north.`Karani who could swim took`the islands. And Shir took`what was left, the barren`lands.``The Splintering of the Four.``As time went by, the four`great kerrans of the prophecy`had children. It was then`that Partha Shir, son of`Shir, stepped forth on a day`of mist to claim leadership`of all kerrans under him. But`the children of Kajek,`Shahar, and Karani lay claim`that the prophecy called for`the rocks and the mist. Nairu`Karani, daughter of Karani,`proclaimed that the mist is`the water and the rocks are`the islands and it was her`kin that would be queen.`Kiara Shahar chose not to`speak for she was wise. Faern`Kajek had the wisdom of his`father and said the wise one`would come from no tribe`but unite them all as one. ``Time passed and the moon`left the sky. This did not`please the children of`Shahar, Karani, or Shir.`Great anger took hold`and battles raged for`many years. Thus began`the splintered ages. `	0
knovahshir2	The Splintered Age`` Much suffering had been felt`during the time of the`splintered tribes. In battle`Partha had been mortally`wounded. In remorse for what`he had done to cause such`blood, Partha tore the fangs`from his mouth and gave them`to the wisest of his sons,`Ratha Shir, and spoke to him.`"You are not my heir, but you`are the wisest of your kin.`You must show these to your`brothers and tell them they`must battle no more. You must`lead them with wisdom."  But`when Ratha had done as his`father had asked, he was`slain by his eldest of`brothers in secrecy. The`years of war and death raged`on.``Safra, daughter of Faern`Kajek, went to the Shir to`ask for peace once more. It`was then that Vahaan, son`of Partha, was taken by her`beauty. Vahaan and Nairu`agreed to peace for Vahaan`was nearby when Partha had`spoke to his uncle Ratha. But`he was the youngest of his`kin and knew they would slay`him for his thoughts. Vahaan`took the fangs of Partha and`Nairu journeyed with him to`the lands of Shahar to ask`the spirits for guidance.`Many years passed and many`kinsman lay slain upon the`fields. On the day that the`moon returned, the mists rose`from the great veil. Kejaan`Kerrath stepped forth from`the mist with Vahaan and`Safra at his side. "It is the`wise one!" They cried out.`The Kerrans saw that this was`good, but some Shahar and`Karani took their leave and`vanished to the lands. All`that chose to remain were`united as one as the prophecy`claimed. The golden Age had`begun. ``The Kingdom on Odus``Kejaan chose the wildest from`the clan of the Shir, those`who were outsiders of their`kin. From them he made his`nobles and warriors. Kejaan`took the wisest from the clan`of Kajek. From them he made`his shaman and advisors.`Kejaan took the quickest from`the clan of Shahar, from them`he made his hunters and`farmers. The children of`Nairu, the Karani, became the`servants of the kingdom.`United, the Komiyat Kerrath`prospered for many years.`Kejaan built his palace of`gold within the claws of the`four fingered paw.`	0
knovahshir3	The Furless Ones``On the lands of the vanished`Shahar, a new civilization`emerged unnoticed. They were`the furless ones who had`come from the sea. They`had built their homes of`large white stones in the`lands of the golden mist.`They could call forth spirits`of fire and of earth, beings`of water and air stood`as warriors by their side.`They did not speak to`the beasts as the Kerrath`would but could bend`them to their will. They were`at war with the furless ones`who spoke to the dead. Kejaan`heard the anguish of the`spirits of the dead and went`to speak with the furless`ones who spoke to them.`He asked them to lay down`their magic for it had harmed`the ancient spirits. Many`days passed and Kejaan`returned sickly and pale.`They would not listen to his`words and the aching of the`spirits burned his very`heart. Kejaan returned to`the mist and his son Vah`stepped forth as the king.```The Shifting``Vah gathered his strongest,`the nobles, the Shir. He sent`the weaker ones away from`the kingdom and back to the`wild. Vah called to the shir`and proclaimed this was`prophecy, but none`understood. Vah called to the`spirits in the unknown`tongue. None could move, the`time of the shifting was at`hand. The spirits wailed`around the city of the Shir.`The furless ones that`disturbed the dead gathered`at the gates, pursued by the`furless ones who commanded`fire, earth, air, and water.`A great mist enveloped the`city of the Shir and Vah`cried to the spirits as loud`as his voice permitted.`When the shifting had ended,`they found themselves in the`darkened lands. The land and`the air had changed and the`voices of the spirits could`not speak their tongue. Vah`cried out to the Shir "Hear`me and know that I am your`kin, my blood is of yours and`you are my people." He pulled`forth the fang of Partha and`spoke the truth of Ratha's`death.

KobScr1	In the age of scale we arrived,                 The scaled beasts of the Dragon Queen ruled the surface and skies.                              All else belonged to our people,                By Brell Serilis' hands were we created and     delivered to the Underfoot of Norrath.          As the numbers of our ancestors grew, so did    the powers of the ancient shaman.               Tribes began to form and territory became       disputed.                                       For ages the blood flowed and the powers of     stone and steel were discovered.	17
KobScr2	In the time of scale a powerful shaman gifted by Brell with the insight needed to unite the ancient tribes rose to power. Under the guidance of King Gkar the ancients developed new techniques of forging ore, replacing old tools with new. Brells most devoted kobolds refined shamanistic rituals to harness the powers of the Plane of Underfoot, blessing the miners with divine strength and speed, and resistances to the harsh volcanic and frozen regions of their subterranean world. The united  ancient tribes constructed a city for their king.The capital of Kolbok was constructed and many monuments were erected to King Gkar and his patron, Brell Serilis.	17
KobScr3	It was during King Gkar's reign when Brell decided he alone could not break Veeshans grasp on the world of Norrath. Brell met with Tunare, Prexus, and Rallos Zek and told them of Veeshans New World.  Brell kept the source of his information about the world a secret as he made a pact with the gathered Gods.  They agreed they would assist Brell in releasing the world from Veeshan only if Norrath was divided equally among them.  Brells greed overcame him and he decided to keep our people a secret and created a new race called Dwarf.	17
KobScr4	Brell had not anticipated the attentiveness of his peers, especially the War Lord Rallos Zek. Mostly out of fear of the Warlords wrath for his deception Brell turned his back on our people. Leaving our King without guidance and our shamans powerless with prayers unanswered.  King Gkar fell into despair as his people and kingdom crumbled around him. He died with no successor and our people were thrust into chaos. The howls of our people echoed throughout the caverns of Norrath as we defiled the monuments devoted to the God that abandoned us.	17
KobScr5	Three hundred years after the fall of King Gkar, Brell recognized the opportunity to form a second pact thus allowing him to strengthen his hold on the subterranean lands.  This time Fizzlethorpe, Cazic-Thule, and Rallos Zek agreed to the pact. Brell created the Gnomes and placed them near the lands of the Dwarves. The societies of the Dwarves and Gnomes expanded rapidly at this time and we kobolds now reduced to a tribal people inevitably discovered the Kingdoms of the younger races.  Recognizing the monuments erected by the short ones as being devoted to Brell we Kobolds were enraged and a great bloody war began beneath the surface of Norrath.	17
KobScr6	The surface races consumed in their own wars against the minions of Rallos Zek paid little heed to the turmoil beneath the surface.  So mighty were the mortal forces of Zek that the other Gods also overlooked the subterranean war, but Rallos Zek confident in his forces' might and innately attracted to warfare and bloodshed silently watched the developing conflict and chuckled at the bloody result of Brells folly and deception.  Seeing the opportunity to strengthen his forces and gain a strong grip on the subterranean realms, Rallos Zek appeared before our people.	17
KobScr7	As Rallos walked among us he gazed into our souls, seeking one with the most rage, the strongest will, and the most disciplined mind. Rallos found what he sought within an elderly shaman whose years of powerlessness had fed his despair and resentment of Brell and the short ones.  His heart had turned black and his spirit was at the brink of decaying to oblivion. Rallos swept the elderly shaman into his plane and yanked the remnants of the shamans spirit from his body, replacing it with a bit of The Warlords own life. Rallos then forged the despair ridden soul into a sword for his new demi-god, Rolfron Zek, the Lord of Despair.	17

language	``On Language, Research & Magic``                By``Geoffrey, Arch Mage of Norrath``````Much of the recent research`done by young Magi has dealt`with the piecing together of`old spells.  Since many of`the spell fragments found`are not written in common,`I have been asked to write`a brief treatment on`languages, research and`magic.`````The history of magic on`Norrath can be divided into`four eras.`````````The most recent historical`period saw conflict between`dark elven necromancy and the`magic of the forefathers to`those who now live on Erudin.``Books from this period are`alternately written in Elder`Teir'Dal and Old Erudin.````Preceding this conflict was`the era of the Combine`Empire, whose glory stretched`across the length of Antonica.`This civilization flourished`for a handful of decades`before their magical powers`became so great that the`dragons of the world awoke`and grew jealous.```All that remains now of the`Combine Empire is steel and`ash.``Scrolls from this period were`written in Combine.```````Before the ascent of the`Combine Empire was the Age of`the Dragons.  These powerful`beasts ruled all of Norrath`under an iron claw and a`spell-quick voice.  Their`wizardry was dark and strong.`Magic from this period was`recorded in the Runes of`Dragon Tongue.``In the beginning, during the`Age of Scale, were those`known to me only as the Elder`Dragons.  Their language is`as harsh as it is difficult,`as twisted as it is beguiling.`The rewards of learning`Elder Dragon are, however,`plentiful, as to speak their`tongue is to know the`language of magic itself.``	-1
LDoNAlchemy	The alchemical profession `is one that is well `respected throughout the `world, our potions bring `healing to the sick, help `to focus the magical `energies of casters, and if`the right herbs and `chemicals were used, could `even grant the drinker `abilities they would not `normally have.`It has long been rumored `that our ancestors were `able to craft potions that `were able to affect small `groups of people `concentrated in a small `area. This process has been`unknown for centuries. . . `Unknown until now!````I've managed a breakthrough`in my research! I believe `I've found a way to craft `our potions to have a `larger effect to those `around them. The solution `was not an easy one to `find, especially `considering it requires a `different mode of thinking.```It seems that in the recent`discovery of the various `dungeons across Norrath, `several new classifications`of herbs and chemicals were`uncovered. These herbs and `chemicals are very potent. `Combine these with a new `method of processing the `herbs, and I've been able `to bottle what I consider a`"mist". `These mists, when uncorked,`will encompass a small `area, enhancing the air in `the immediate vicinity, `granting all those who `breathe the air, the effect`of the potions. The "mists"`are a bit weaker than `drinking a normal potion, `due to the potency factor, `but it is a great way to `give various benefits to `those around you.``Here is a list of the mists`that I've managed to create`thus far:````````Mist of the Wolf -`1 Empty Vial`2 Wolf Blood`1 Bistort`1 Woundwart`1 Saprophytic Moss`1 Cork``````Breathless Mist -`1 Empty Vial`2 Sage Leaves`1 Oak Moss`1 Woundwart`1 Cave Algae`1 Cork``````Weightless Mist - `1 Empty Vial`1 Birthwart`1 Comfrey`1 Figswort`1 Hydrangea`1 Deep Cavern Fungus`1 Cork`	0

LDoNFletching1	Having learned the basic `art of fletching from the `greatest teachers of `Surefall, I set out to `expand on their ideas.  I `wanted to find a new type `of wood that would be more `susceptible to woodworking.` This new wood also needed `to have a great deal of `flexibility to add to the `power of each shot.  `Traveling through the `northern tundra I came upon`a mine entrance that was `nearly covered in snow.  I `swept away enough to `wriggle my way in.  I was `surprised at how well kept `this mine was.  As a matter`of fact it wasn't a mine at`all but some sort of `underground storage area.  ``There were many strange `breeds of plants growing `here.  One of them was a `type of sedge I had never `seen before.  Its boughs `were long and slender.  I `went to examine it closer `and tried to cut a branch `off.  It was surprisingly `resilient.  I gathered as `many branches as I could `and took them back to `Surefall were I would try `to work with them.``There I applied the same `teachings I learned when `working with Shadewood.	0
LDoNJewelcraft	I determined that the gems I`found in my travels were `extremely durable, but also `carried magical properties. `The geode bestows physical `properties to the wearer, `increasing both their `stamina, and strength.  The `amethyst shared with its `owner the ability to ward `off disease and poison, and `boost overall life force.  `The wearer of polished `quartz is able to channel `magical energies from their `surrounding and increase `their intelligence and `wisdom of things.  Each of `these gems mounted nicely in`enchanted and non enchanted `silver, electrum, gold, `platinum, and velium.	0
LDoNSmithing	In order to make these new `armor sets you will need to`start with the creation of `the temper.  You can brew `these up using a flask of `water and one of the `following components: `Gargoyle Granite, Sand `Verbena, Pondweed, Goblin `Bone, or Ice Lichen.```When you have this temper `created you can then start `to work on the main focus `of smithing.  To make a `sturdy set of plate armor `you will need to work with `a smithy hammer, a flask of`water, superb leather `padding, the appropriate `plate mold, varying sheets `of medium quality metal, `and the temper of choice.`Bracers, collar, and visors`will need one sheet of `medium quality folded `sheets of metal.`Boots, pauldrons, `vambraces, cloak, girth, `and gauntlets will need two`sheets of medium quality `folded sheets of metal.`Greaves and breastplate `will need three sheets of `medium quality folded `sheets of metal.``For a durable but light set`of ringmail you will need `to work with a smithy `hammer, a flask of water, `the appropriate chainmail `pattern, varying numbers of`high quality rings, and the`temper of choice.```Bracelet, gorget, and veil `will need one set of high `quality rings. Boots, `mantle, sleeves, skirt, `cloak, and gloves will need`two sets of high quality `rings. Leggings and tunic `will need three sets of `high quality rings.`	0

Lxanvon1	The Necropolis of Lxanvon`                  and the`Arrival of the Plague Bringer``In a Norrathian age long`past, when dragons ruled the`lands, seas, and skies, an`ancient race did spring`forth from the will of an`unknown god. They were a`cunning and powerful race of` beings, able to survive in`a harsh world ruled by the`scaled children of Veeshan.`The true name of this`extinct civilization has`been lost to the mists of`time, the evidence of their`existence buried and all`but destroyed by the`elements and the forces of`change.``The eldest of dragons`sometimes whisper tales of`this lost race of beings who`were the first to stand`against and slay the great`children of Veeshan. They`speak of them to their`young, as a human mother`would tell ghost stories to`her child. The dragons`whispered tales of a`great kingdom of wicked`yet noble beings that built`cities from the bones and`sinew of the slain children`of Veeshan. This is one`such tale, passed down to`the scribes of New Tanaan`many years past by the`dragon sorcerer Ulvaxazoviak.``Many ages ago, in a time`that only the spirits of the`ancestor dragons can recall,`a long dead ancient race,`The Xulous they are called`in the tales of my kind, did`build upon the lands that`would become Tunaria a`great necropolis to house`their dead kings. The crypts`of the necropolis were`fashioned from preserved`remains of slain dragons`and it was called Lxanvon,`which means in the tongue`of The Xulous, 'Kings Rest'.`As the necropolis filled`with the dead Xulous`royalty, honored and revered`in death as much as in life,`a festering evil began to`take over in the lowest`bowels of the crypts of the`kings. The Xulous, through`their adoration and`reverence of their rotting`kings, their defilement of`the dead children of`Veeshan, and their`dependence on the deaths`of dragons for the expansion`of their kingdoms did`unknowingly bring a powerful`and ancient evil to Norrath.`As years passed, the evil`presence in the bowels of `Lxanvon grew stronger, and `there, within the rotting `corpses of those ancient `kings, Bertoxxulous was born.	0
Lxanvon2	The royal priests of the`Xulous kingdoms often`journeyed from their ivory`cities to Lxanvon on behalf`of their people, to deliver`offerings and praises to`their dead kings.`Bertoxxulous, donning the`decaying bodies of the dead`Xulous nobles, appeared`before these royal priests`demanding obedience,`reverence, and sacrifices.`Bertoxxulous deceived and`corrupted the minds of the`royal priests and their`allegiance belonged to the`Lord of Death and Decay`above their living kings.`Amidst these firsts priests`of decay, one was held above`the others, Ultor Szanvon`the Putrid; he led the`priests of decay in the`spreading of their dark`doctrine. Ultor, an`influential priest in service`to the mightiest of the`Xulous nobles schemed and`murdered his way into the`position of chief advisor to`the living Xulous King.`Ultor convinced the Xulous`King to visit the tombs of`his ancestors, and there`within the presence of`Bertoxxulous' full might he`performed a dark ritual,`sacrificing the king in the`bowels of the crypt. Through`the dark ritual Ultor`summoned twelve spirits of`previous Xulous kings and`bound them to his service.``The risen undead kings rose`armies of the dead from the`necropolis of Lxanvon and`spread across the lands`ravaging all in their path,`and leaving only death and`destruction in their wake.`Those who were not destroyed`by the weapons of the undead`armies were killed slowly by`a deadly plague, carried by`the risen kings, and spread`like wildfire amidst the`Xulous. Their entire race`succumbed to the pestilence`and the Xulous were no more.`Bertoxxulous, pleased and`swollen with pride by his`genocidal accomplishment`called his minions back to`the necropolis that had`served as their resting`place for so many years.`The risen Xulous kings`gathered in the bowels of`their crypts as a great mist`enveloped Lxanvon.`The ancient dragons watched`from afar as the mists`cleared, revealing only a`barren and broken landscape`where the necropolis had`once lied. It is said that`the necropolis of Lxanvon`still exists in the Plane of`Disease, unchanged from`when the ancient dragons`witnessed its vanishing`from Norrath, and that`the form Bertoxxulous`favors when visiting` Lxanvon is a twisted visage`of the long dead race he`destroyed, so many ages`ago.`	0

meldrath1	It is said that Meldrath had a`conjoined twin with whom he `was connected at the chest. `One boy's heart was as pure`as the waters of the Vasty`Deep and his eyes shone`with a beautiful light and`the other's heart was as`dark and cold as the waters`of the Ink Sea and his`eyes were as black as two`pools of oil. Their two`hearts beat as one, each `balanced by the extreme of the`other. So balanced were they,`in fact, that they were both `known as Meldrath because`no one thought of them`as two, let alone suspected`the extremes of their souls.`They lived in peace, gliding`through Ak'Anon wrapped in `each other's arms like slow `dancers.`Meldrath's mother, however,`wanted the two sons she `thought she deserved and `constantly sought a way to `disconnect them.  One day `Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, `ruler of the Plane of Mischief`disguised himself as a healer `and gave their mother a magic `sword to disconnect them.`She ran home and, finding`them asleep, plunged the`sword between them.`Both were unharmed and`the two rubbed their eyes`sleepily. ``She rejoiced, but as she `looked from one to the other `she noticed for the first time`that one was beautiful and the`other ugly. One looked at her `with loving, sweet eyes and `the other with hatred.  `Suddenly, the beautiful `Meldrath began to rise higher `and higher into the air. His `mother screamed and tried to `hold him down but the ugly `Meldrath bit her leg and `stomped on her foot.  The `beautiful Meldrath floated up `to the surface of Norrath and `into the sky and was never `seen again.`	8
meldrath2	The extent of the ugly `Meldraths wickedness and `insanity was not at first `apparent to the citizens of `Ak'Anon. Meldraths temper `tantrums and fits of rage `abated as he matured yet still`he had the look of hatred in `his eyes, thus found few `friends amongst his fellow `gnomes. Those who did `associate with the ugly `spiteful Meldrath tended to be`other gnomes of notorious `repute.``Eventually Meldrath managed`to join the Eldrich Collective`under the tutelage of a wizard`who believed Meldrath was `simply suffering from a `traumatized youth and could `yet become a respectable `citizen of Ak'Anon. To the `surprise of many and the `pleasure of his mentor, `Meldrath excelled at the `wizardly arts and quickly rose`through the ranks of the `Eldrich Collective. Meldrath `became particularly `fascinated; some would say `obsessed, with magic that `dealt with teleportation, `translocation, and alternate `planes of existence.`Meldrath's talent for the `sorcerous arts grew to the `point where he rivaled, if not`excelled, his mentors and he `began to select pupils of his `own to aid him with his `research into what he called `"other worlds". It was obvious`to those who associated with `Meldrath that he sought `something in these other `worlds, but whatever it was, `Meldrath never spoke of it. `Then one day, Meldrath was `gone. Meldraths pupils did not`admit to knowing the `whereabouts of their mentor, `or the nature of his passion `with other worlds.``It is not known precisely when`Meldrath returned to Ak'Anon, `but it has been estimated `based on events that we now `know were tied to Meldraths `return. Over a period of time `Meldraths pupils began to also`vanish from the Library `Mechanamagica, and despite`the Eldrich Collectives`inquiries into the` disappearances no `clues as to the nature of the `disappearances were found.`	8
meldrath3	The mines of Ak'Anon had`long been used as a source of`materials for the construction`of Ak'Anons clockwork guards `and servants.`That changed the day the`whereabouts of the missing`sorcerer Meldrath and`his pupils were discovered. `The miners that toiled in the `mines had gone to the mines `early that morning and did not`return to their homes and `families that night. King `Ak'Anon ordered a small patrol`of guards to investigate the`whereabouts of the miners`and they to did not return`from the mines.`What did emerge that`night, shortly after the `patrol had entered the mines, `were creatures of death, `shadow, and flame.``The animated corpses of the `miners, along with creatures `summoned from other worlds `stalked the tunnels of Ak'Anon`slaying and destroying all in `their path and swelling their `numbers with the animated `corpses of the freshly dead. `By the time King Ak'Anon could`organize the Gemcutters, `Eldrich Collective, and Deep `Muses to defeat the `monstrosities the devastation `had reached proportions never`before afflicted upon the city`of Ak'Anon.`A powerful charm was cast by `the most powerful of the `Eldrich Collective that `temporarily nullified the use `of magic within Ak'Anon while `the Gem Cutters and Deep`Muses fought their way`through the tunnels of`Ak'Anon towards the mines.``When the forces of King `Ak'Anon reached the mines`they found them devastated`far worse than the rest`of the city.`The mechanical mining `apparatuses utilized by the `miners had been destroyed`and the clockwork miners`and ore haulers had been`reprogrammed to slaughter.`To the chagrin of the good`gnomes of Ak'Anon,`Meldrath and his minions had `already fled the city, their `tainted seed of corruption `already planted.`	8
meldrath4	Meldrath and his apprentices,`exiled from Ak'Anon and`collectively dubbed the Asylum`of the Mad, began construction`of a fortress deep in the `Steamfont Mountains.`For years the Asylum of`the Mad constructed`clockwork war-machines,`far more advanced than`any clockworks previously`constructed by the `tinkers, that plagued the`Watchmen of Ak'Anon.``Meanwhile Meldrath's `influence festered within`Ak'Anon, in what are now`known as the Mines of` Malfunction. Evil `gnomes practicing the dark `arts first brought to Ak'Anon `by Meldrath the Mad took `refuge in the destruction of `the mines where they practiced`their dark arts and recruited `other gnomes to their wicked `ways. These evil gnomes, `surrounded by death and `destruction, abandoned their `patron deities Brell Serilis `and Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, `and vowed allegiance to the `dark god, Bertoxxulous. Thus `the Dark Reflection was born.``Eventually the Asylum of the `Mad were captured, slain, or `disappeared, never to be seen `again. Meldrath however `remains at large, plotting and`executing his mad schemes.`The mad sorcerer has somehow`earned the allegiance of a `tribe of minotaurs that `capture gnomes to toil in`Meldraths mines and complete`his twisted mechanical `fortress. Many of the Eldrich `Collective have speculated as `to the nature of Meldraths `madness and talents with both`sorcery and mechanics.`As long as Meldrath still`lives they may have a`chance to discover `the answers they seek.`	8
meldrath5	After his separation with his`evil conjoined twin, the`good Meldrath ascended into`the planes. What deity is`responsible for his ascension`is unknown, but most`attribute the act to`Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe,`the deity that provided`Meldrath's mother with the`means to separate her sons.``A demi-plane came into`existence as the good`Meldrath ascended to the`realms of the gods. This`young demi-plane, the`Plane of Innovation, was`ideally suited for the purest`and brightest of any gnome`to ever walk the face of`Norrath, and its ruler was to`be Meldrath the Marvelous.``Meldrath matured from his`childhood in his new home`surrounded by clockwork`companions of his own design`and an endless stockpile of`supplies for which to tinker`marvels never before imagined`by mortal or god. For decades`Meldrath the Marvelous`tirelessly planned and`constructed his mechanical`marvels while his brother,`Meldrath the Malignant, honed`his magical abilities on`Norrath and sought the`whereabouts of his lost`"perfect"sibling.``Eventually through his`intensive study and mastery`of spells dealing with`teleportation, translocation,`and the planes, Meldrath`the Malignant discovered`what had become of his lost`brother. The rage and hatred`that festered in Meldrath`the Malignant's black heart`overcame him and he was`driven mad with jealousy and`a desire to best his "perfect"`brother that had been gifted`as a child with immortality.``While his brother was gifted`with an amazing mind for`logic, reason, and invention,`Meldrath the Malignant was`gifted, or some would say`cursed, with passion, a`thirst for power, and a`talent for the magical arts.`It was not long before he`found a way to penetrate the`barrier between worlds and`enter the Plane of Innovation`to seek his revenge. Meldrath`the Malignant quietly`performed a ritual in the`confines of his study at the`Library Mechanamagica and`unbeknownst to the Eldrich`Collective or his own pupils,`transported himself to the`Plane of Innovation.``Cloaked in magical darkness`and silence, Meldrath the`Malignant slipped past the`clockwork guards and alarm`systems with ease, not`realizing that he surely`would have been detected`if not for his resemblance`to his goodly brother, the`clockworks did not recognize`the look of hatred in the`evil Meldraths eyes or see`deep enough to notice his`sickly black heart. Thus`Meldrath the Malignant moved`unhindered through the Plane`of Innovation, sabotaging the`creations of Meldrath the`Marvelous and stealing many`of his diagrams and plans for`mechanical constructs.``When his work was done,`Meldrath the Malignant`hastily retreated from the`Plane of Innovation but by`some mishap of his`teleportation spell, ended`up in a place called New`Tanaan. The planar city`baffled the already mad gnome`so he stuck to the shadows`cloaked again in magical`darkness and silence.`Huddled quietly out of`sight, Meldrath the Malignant`observed magic the likes`of which he had never`seen, and thus immediately`desired to possess it.`Stealing a magical tome and`the reagents necessary for`his teleportation spell from`a Teir'Dal inhabitant of New`Tanaan, Meldrath once again`performed his ritual to`return home and this time`succeeded in arriving at his`study in Ak'Anon.``In order to prevent his`fellow sorcerers of the`Eldrich Collective from`discovering his pilfered`clockwork diagrams and`Teir'Dal tome, Meldrath`the Malignant gathered his`most prized possessions from`his study and snuck deep`into the mines beneath`Ak'Anon to study the tome`that would bring the secrets`of the dark arts of`Necromancy to the Gnomes`of Ak'Anon.``After his brother's retreat`from the Plane of Innovation,`it quickly became apparent`to Meldrath the Marvelous`that something was amiss.`Meldrath hastily attempted to`undo the damage that had`been wrought but was`overcome by the sabotaged`machinations and imprisoned`by his own creations.`It is in this prison within`the plane of his own`design where Meldrath`the Marvelous remains`in captivity.`	8

MilasFrills	This is the only story I know `now, now that I have been `stripped of my corporeal `essence on Norrath. My slayer `was a mighty wyvern, born of `dragon kin and survived `through the hardships of the `lands for years upon years. I `know now that I destined to be`a protector of this tomb, for `the purpose of spreading my `story and keeping those who `would foolishly follow in my `footsteps out of here.``I do not know what this may `mean for my friends Paldar and`Ulessa, however I do know that`they must never try to follow `in my footsteps either, for `the good of the land. It is `with this protection in mind `that I must learn the form of `the great wyvern, learn how it`moves, how it wields its `mighty claws, and how it keeps`at bay those who would attack `it.``Drakes are easy, for they are `simple minded and provide no `need for extensive thought. `They are warriors, through and`through, and will not cease `until they are dead, or their `foe is dead. Wyverns have the `intelligence to take the `magical elements of their `surrounding and use them to `better themselves. They can `force the air around them into`a highly impactful and very `deadly screech that will `deafen those who hear it.``It is this power that I am to `become. This is my legacy now,`and I shall excel at it, `regardless of the consequences`to myself or to those who I `once called friends.`	0
MilasMem	Day 1`Far and away, this is the most`exciting thing I've ever done.`I never imagined that there `would be a time when I could `find a beast of myth and `legend simply be trekking as I`have always done. I only wish `Paldar and Ulessa could have `come along with me to find `him! This will be most `exciting!`Day 15`I wonder how long it is going `to take for me to find out `where this creature is hidden.`From what I've learned so far,`it was kept far away from `mortals so that there would `not be the chance of him being`awakened and again dealing `strife to the inhabitants of `the lands. I cannot for the `life of me find out where such`a place that could hold this `prismatic lord could be.``Day 83`It has been long since I last `wrote, but only because there `has been nothing to write `about. The leads I have gotten`from various vagrants have `been misleading and `uneventful. I wonder if I `might be wasting my time. No, `that can't be possible, for `the rewards I'll reap will be `in every way worth the effort `of finding this tomb.``Day 596`After so long, I have finally `found a statue of a sleeping `dragon. I had almost given up `hope, but it is here in the `middle of the Eastern Wastes. `There is an inscription on it `that reads, He whose prismatic`might shall not be freed will `be corrupted by perpetual `greed. It also shows the way `to the tomb! I'm so excited, `and so close!``Day 603`At long last, I have finally `found the tomb! It is immense `and marvelous, with huge `ceilings, and beasts of burden`that are larger than life. I `go now to venture through it `and meet this fabled Sleeper, `perhaps I can learn from him!``Day 603, part 2`I have made my way into a huge`library, filled to the walls `with books.

In order`to extract Quicksilver from`the ore the CINNABAR must be`ground in a mortar and pestle`then distilled. The most`effective way I have found of`distilling the cinnabar is`soaking it in GNOMISH SPIRITS.`The result is a dense silvery`liquid metal that corrodes`organic materials, including`flesh and internal organs.	5

Mujaki1	Mujaki the Devourer, as chronicled by Sage Unimvariea of the Gatecallers of Erudin ``Mujaki was born the first child to Erudite couple: Mage Tevrai and Cleric Etumara. His father, Tevrai, had high hopes for a son to follow in his footsteps and become a powerful wielder of magics. However, Mujaki seemed to lack the spark for magical pursuits early on. Much to his father's chagrin, little Mujaki liked to play more and had a physical affinity for the world around him, not a magical one. ``The couple, Tevrai and Etumara, looked forward to bringing another child into the world, but met with little success. Whatever ailed Etumara after her first birth did not allow her to conceive again. This was a serious point of consternation for Tevrai, who desired another heir who might carry on his magical research. It was a notable point of shame for Etumara. She found comfort in the church of Prexus, focusing on helping those she could there when she could not please her husband. This grew a rift between the couple and for several years they existed in a somewhat detached, distant relationship. ``All of this was lost on young Mujaki, save that for some reason he did not please his father and his mother was often less than happy. This weighed heavily on the young mind, planting seeds of guilt and inadequacy. As he grew in his childhood, Mujaki was often found at his mother's side in the church of Prexus and was a source of comfort and solace for her as she delighted in his advancement in the "lesser" arts, as his Father would say. ``As Mujaki approached the age of 7, his parents rejoiced as Etumara was again with child! Her infertility seemed to have been overcome. Tevrai was nearly obsessed with the possibility of a magically adapt heir. Young Mujaki simply looked forward to the promise of another playmate. However, as the pregnancy progressed, it was clear that it would not be a smooth one. Etumara was not carrying the child well and complications developed late in the term. As fate would have it, Etumara would deliver to Tevrai a beautiful baby boy adept in magics, but at the cost of her own life. ``Tevrai's sorrow knew little in the way of bounds, and his anguish turned to self blame for it was he who had so desired another child. It was only the responsibility for his new son that focused his attention enough to keep Tevrai from destroying himself in his mourning. The infant was named Etumer in memory of his mother.``Mujaki was crushed nearly as much as Tevrai. However, with little love coming from his Father, he found solace in the support of the clerics of Prexus and his mothers many friends there. Despite his best understanding of what happened, Mujaki could not help but harbor blame on his infant brother for taking his mother from him. ``As the years passed Etumer would greatly please his father with his aptitude for the magical arts and further alienate Mujaki from the family. Despite this rift, Mujaki still looked to his father for acceptance and worked exceedingly hard to prove his worth to Tevrai. He would devote his life to the ways of Prexus and became a devout Paladin to the Ocean Lord. ``As Mujaki entered into manhood, he became attracted to the young Lady Yuntair, a magician who had gained an early reputation as exceedingly skilled in magic. ```At the same time that a relationship was developing between Yuntair and Mujaki, Etumer was discovering something wonderful, powerful and innately sinister: the ways of necromancy. Initially introduced as something innocent and an outgrowth of his regular magical studies, Etumer was seduced by the easy power that necromancy offered. He could not hold these discoveries from his Father. This infected Tevrai with what started as an innocent step in a logical evolution of study and turned into something foul and seductive in its possibility for power.	2
Mujaki2	Even when the root principles `of The Faceless, Cazic Thule, `were revealed by Etumer's dark`friends, it was sufficiently `clouded in righteous logical `posturing to not sway the son `or his over ambitious father `from delving deeper into new `possibilities.  ``Heady with newfound power and `possibilities, Etumer was `introduced to Mujaki's `acquaintance, the lovely Lady `Yuntair.  Smitten by her `radiant beauty and `subconsciously infected by his`father's contempt for Mujaki, `Etumer went about making `inroads with Yuntair.  Playing`out the same seduction that he`had with his father, Etumer `swayed Yuntair by appealing to`her magical questing for `power.  ``Mujaki was tormented by his `position.  He languished in `indecision of what to do, `stymied by his own iron grip `of the church's principles `coupled with his deep-set `feelings of inadequacy toward `his family.  This started a `plague of dreams that `tormented him with `possibilities of what may `happen should he not find a `way to repair his many down `fallings.``By the time Mujaki moved to `salvage his relationship, he `was too late.  Initially, he `uncovered his brother's `treachery by stumbling upon `Etumer and Lady Yuntair in a `very questionable situation, `further compounded with `evidence of necromancy.  `Thunderstruck, Mujaki could `only flee the scene, battling `with his inner feelings and `duty-bound honor to reveal the`necromancy to the Erudin `authorities.  Mujaki `approached his father for `guidance, only to be spurned `with statements alluding to `Etumer's superiority in `ability, despite the deficit `of his age.  Tevrai reasoned `that Etumer should rightfully `win the Lady Yuntair over `Mujaki.  ``This, coupled with his `father's casual dismissal of `the Necromancy, slapped `Mujaki's ego down and spiraled`him further into self `questioning.  Grappling with `what to do, he pondered and `paced in inactivity.  `Throughout this, his sleep was`wracked by the sendings of `Terris Thule, who delighted in`twisting the knives of his `situation deeper into his `psyche.  ``Pushing his own teachings `aside and seeking acceptance `at the cost of his own `principles, Mujaki returned to`his Father seeking guidance `into magics and even the `teachings of necromancy if `only he could find favor from `his father and use this `knowledge to impress Yuntair `to reciprocate his unrequited `love.  While this seemed to `improve the situation for a `time, it ultimately alienated `him from the one stability in `Mujaki's life: the church of `Prexus.``The situation came crashing to`calamity as Mujaki stumbled in`on his Father, Brother and `Lady Yuntair, along with `several of Etumer's friends, `engaged in debased necromantic`experiments.  Suddenly gripped`with an overwhelming loathing `for his Father's abuse, his `deep rooted hatred for his `brother for the loss of his `mother and the betrayal by his`loved, Mujaki swept into `action and bloodily tore these`objects of his torment `asunder.  ``His mind wracked with what he `had committed, Mujaki ran from`his house into the night `streets of Erudin, his mind `lost to a frenzy of emotion.  `As he ran, Terris Thule guided`his step to miss-place and `with a shriek, Mujaki fell `headlong into a side ally, his`own blade, bloody with gore of`his family, tore through his `midsection.  It took a long `time for Mujaki's life force `to ebb from his torn body as `his mind wracked in spasms of `calamity and insanity.``Mujaki's essence was caught up`and trapped by The Dream `Scorcher, Terris Thule.  She `played upon Mujaki's `inadequacy and twisted his `direction to reaping the `essences of those he now feels`are beneath him, in his own `twisted logic.  Finding power `in undeath, Mujaki the `Devourer is the scourge of `weak willed dreamers.  His ego`is now stoked by the legions `of nightmares he sends forth `to collect essences for `Terris' torments.  It is `unknown what it would take to `free Mujaki and ultimately `place his spirit to rest.	2

NCTbook1	22nd July, 3222``Good grief.  Just as one `pointless expedition into the `backside of civilisation `finishes, another begins. `` I always knew that cursed `Provost Tredore was jealous of`my studies and the success of `my experiments.  ``Why else would he send me, `Derion Livingstone, on these `Gods-forsaken errands, and not`one of the seemingly endless `supply of novices that he `foolishly admits to our dear `Academy of Arcane Sciences?``Jealousy, simple jealously.  `We'll see who it is that has `the last laugh when I return. `I have plans for our Provost.`23rd July, 3222``It seems that we're destined `for the Feerrott; if there `were a more dingy and `unsanitary place, then I am `quite certain that I've not `heard of it.``Between the stench of Oggok, `the Gypsy-infested Mountains `of Rathe and Innothule Swamp, `I cannot imagine a place I'd `rather be less.  Even the `blasted druids threw cabbage `at us as we passed the Old `Rings.``Provost Tredore claims that `the filthy Tae Ew lizards are `stirring up trouble, something`to do with a breach into an `alter plane.  I don't believe `it for a moment.`24th July, 3222``Curiouser and curiouser.  We `reached the outskirts of the `Tae Ew temple this morning; it`certainly appears.. different.` `There is a distinct taint in `the balance of the planar `forces here, emanating from `the temple itself.  Could that`fool Tredor have been correct?``My faithful servant, Kinopio, `is setting up the tents.  The `juniors assigned to me - `Scrapsnatcher, Aluram, Morkul `and Felwah - have asked leave `for the evening.``I am not a cruel man, we shall`begin in earnest tomorrow.  `Besides, Kinopio has some `rather decent pipeweed.`25th July, 3222``Felwah seems to have a touch `of madness this morning, `blathering about monsters in `her dreams.``Arcane Sciences cannot depend `on the ramblings of the `weak-willed.  ```I have ordered the doors to `the temple to be forced open -`let us see what these `scienceless heathens are up `to!  Onwards!	12
NCTbook2	Gods help us, we're trapped.  `Trapped in some small chamber `deep within the temple - we `ran, Gods know we ran.  My `magics of concealment should `hide Kinopio and myself from `the searches of the cursed `lizards for a while.``I get ahead of myself, it is `unlike me to be irrational.  I`shall recount the events.`The main temple door led into `a deserted courtyard, absent `of all sound except the `incessant chirp of crickets in`the plants that sprouted from `most of the temple's oddly `regular sandstone buildings.``As our party stood in the `centre of this courtyard, the `huge wooden doors through `which we came slammed shut. `I don't know how, but they `were on us instantly - jumping`out of windows and bushes, `pouring from doors and `alcoves, even dropping out of `the trees.  I've never seen `such an attack, I pray that I `never do again.``It was all that I could do to `protect Kinopio and myself `with my enchantments - many of`the lizards fell to us but `their numbers were.. `overwhelming, without end.  `They have been breeding in `incredible quantity.``We found ourselves separated `from the juniors - fleeing for`a door that led along `countless corridors into the `temple depths.  Here we remain`- for how long I cannot say.`Day 1`Our tiny room appears to have `been used as a storage area, `there are many materials here.` Perhaps some will come in `useful in our escape.  ``My wards of protection are `about the room, it should `remain soundproof for some `time.  The door looks strong. `We both need rest.`Day 2`Within the mounds of jumble, I`found a strange ore.  It seems`local to this area's geology -`and has fascinating `properties.  ``Using my firestaff as a `makeshift forge, I found that `two lumps of this ore could be`enchanted with a vial of `distilled mana - interesting.`Day 3`Kinopio is keeping me awake `with his nightmares.  ``Thankfully, we appear to be `undiscovered.  I hear female `screams after dark.	12
NCTbook3	Day 4`The enchanted ore seems to `bond well with certain jewels `that I have with me: diamonds,`blue diamonds, sapphires, `black sapphires and rubies.``I shall remember to note these`for further investigation on `our return to the Academy.```Day 5`Our rations are low.  Kinopio,`bless his brave Gnomish soul, `dared to step outside the room`today.  He was gone for some `time, and came back with - `well, with a dead Tae Ew `runtling.``The door is secured again. I `wonder if we dare cook this `lizard?`Day 6`Hunger is a cruel thing.  `Kinopio went to work on `cooking the runtling this `morning.``It tastes so good!  Cooked on `a skewer, with a little spice `and some sauce, this lizard `meat is most pleasing.  `Kinopio ate meat rolled in `batwing - such an odd gnome.`Day 7`Gods, a week has passed.  `Kinopio's nightmares are `worse, they are effecting his `judgement.``My day was spent curing the `hide of the runtling - a long `process, using a vial of the `poor creature's blood.  The `result is a hard leather - `perhaps I can put it to use.`Day 8`Kinopio is restless, so I put `him to work with the cured `hide.  He has hidden talents: `from one section of hide he `created a tough belt for `himself, and from another `section of hide he produced a `gorget.  Amazing.``Today's meal consisted of raw `lizard sandwich.  Revolting.`Day 9`Kinopio discovered a barrel, `suitable for brewing, in one `of the piles that line the `walls.  Using two vials of the`runtlings blood and a single `vial of distilled mana, I `managed to distill the `substance into a thick, `viscous fluid.``I shall investigate tomorrow.`Day 10`Kinopio's skills know no `bound.  Using the distilled `blood and two sections of the `hardened hide, he created a `backpack the likes of which I `have never seen before.``From two portions of the `distilled blood, a section of `hide and a whip pattern of his`own he even made a rudimentary`weapon.  ``Our meal today consisted of a `soup - lizard meat in water `from the drain, with a little `sauce, in Kinopio's pot. Ugh.	12
NCTbook4	Day 11`The day went slowly.  Kinopio `and I discussed possible uses `for this cured hide.  He seems`to think that one could `fashion an entire suit of `armour from it, simply using `sections of the cured hide in `various quantity with an `appropriate pattern.``I slept most of the day.`Day 12`Woke in the middle of the `night to Kinopio screaming.  I`must admit that my dreams have`not been too pleasant lately `either.``In a fit of creativity, `Kinopio created us a crude pie`made from the now-festering `lizard meat and a little `dough, in his pie tin. `Day 13`Kinopio tells me that he used `to be a smith of some reknown `in his youth.  I find it easy `to believe.``He spent all afternoon laying `out plans for a set of `chain-mail: a mold, a vial of `the distilled blood, and `several sheets of metal.  If `only we had sheets of metal!`Day 14`What a day.  It started so `well - from a scale temper and`a vial of the lizard's blood `(thankfully still in good `condition after all this time `due to my preservations), I `created a lizard blood temper.` `Then Kinopio passed out.  He `shows no signs of `consciousness.`Day 15`We have survived two weeks.  `The runtling was rotting so `severely that I had to `vapourise it - hopefully my `magics kept the sound `contained.``Kinopio still lies comatose, `as if in a state of `near-death.  I wish that `Felwah were here to cure him.`Day 16`Kinopio awakened!  His eyes `are bloodshot, he does not `look well even to my limited `medical knowledge. ``The stirrings outside the door`have become more pronounced `over the last days, since `Kinopio was unconscious, as if`hundreds of rats were out `there.`Day 17`Though ill, Kinopio has gone `to work with a will.  Using my`lizard-blood temper, he `hammered two pristine lizard `scales together to form a `larger plate - it looks `exceptionally tough, perhaps `we can use it to escape.``I cooked lizard in a little `frosting, with spice - superb.`Day 18`The noises outside are more `evident than ever.  Kinopio `keeps wanting to open the `door.	12
NCTbook5	Day 19`My Gnomish companion has `become obsessed with opening `the door - I turn my back to `find him edging towards it `with a distant look in his `eyes.``My sleep has been restless.  `Sometimes it sounds as if the `very walls of the temple `itself are whispering to me.`Day 20`Kinopio showed me plans for a `suit of full plate armour, `based on the lizard plating `that he constructed several `days ago.``With a smithing hammer, flask `of water, leather padding, `mold and several of the lizard`platings, he claims to be able`to make anything.`Day 21`Kinopio woke before me and ran`out of the door.  He was gone `all morning, and appeared `soaked in blood and sweat in `the afternoon.  ``Locking the door behind him, `he sat in a corner, staring `into space, clutching a `strange silk substance in his `hand.`Day 22`Kinopio sleeps, fitfully.``From two of the strands of the`silk, smeared in some form of `unidentifiable ichor, I was `able to make a crude swatch of`silk.  From whatever creature `this originates, I would `rather not know - it is `strong, and yet flexible.  `Inordinately so.`Day 23`I fear for Kinopio's mental `state, he appears to have gone`quite insane.  Whilst `constantly gibbering about `some kind of sacrifice, his `skilled hands crafted `something from the silk swatch`and a pattern of his own `making - imagine my surprise `when the poor soul presented `me with a hand-sewn cap!  `Day 24`A transformation has occured `in my companion.  His former `state of incoherence and `madness has been replaced by a`firm determinism.  He seems `resolved, though in what I `cannot say.``The cap fits well - it seems `logical that the silk can be `used to make other garments.`Day 25`I awoke to find Kinopio gone. `Where he is I cannot guess, `though the door remains `locked.``The scurrying sounds outside `the door become almost `unbearable in the silence of `the room.  I must stay, I must`wait.. help could be on its `way...`Day 26`I can stand it no longer.``I will find Kinopio, and `together we shall escape.``The door opens?	12

Nodfod1	Day 47``  Crusader Golin and I have discovered what we `believe to be the crypt of the ancient Haggle`Baron Dalnir. It would seem as though the babble`of the goblin slave we caught and tortured turned`out to be accurate. ` Unfortunately we must rest and plan our route`into the depths of this beast. It is filled with`very dangerous creatures. Hopefully we can `overcome the odds and find the final resting `place of the Visceral Dagger and the Grand Forge.`	18
Nodfod2	Day 48` Blast! This IS the Crypt of Dalnir. We found`the entrance which had the ancient Haggle Baron's`name upon it. How foolish of the crypt keepers! `The Crypt is filled with croaks from many races.`They seem to be in some sort of trance and far `more powerful then they appear. We were about to`enter the main tomb when we were assaulted by `the horde. Crusader Golin sustained a major gash`on his shoulder. Before I could cauterize his `wound, blood flowed all over, even this entry.`Tomorrow we shall try to enter the main tomb.`	18
Nodfod3	Day 49` We finally had an opportunity to make a run into`the main tomb, but just as we had the `sarcophagus in our sights, we fell through a `trap door hidden on the floor. We fell into what`appears to be the true Crypt of Dalnir and also `a haven for coerced sarnak! They were upon us in`no time. We ran, but found ourselves in an `unholy church. We fought our way out, but just`as we broke through, Golin's skull was punctured`by what appeared to be a rusted Crusader's `khukri. I am now in hiding, `praying to any god.	18
Nodfod4	Day 49 Eve` The gods were listening. After many hours of `hiding, it appears the beasts have gone to `perform some sort of dark ritual in the church `we found earlier. I could hear the screams of a`sacrifice and the chant of some unknown tongue.`I did a reconnaissance of this level and found `no way out. The walls had tombs built into them`as mortuaries do. None of the doors would open,`but I did find one. I slid the sarcophagus out `with much effort. Before I could attempt to open`it I was scared off by noises within the drawer.`	18
Nodfod5	Day 50`What have I gotten myself into? Soon I shall be`dead. After finding the secret passage through `the drawer, I found myself in a pit of evil. I `crept through the shadows and came upon a locked`door. I am no rogue. The door opened and a beast`walked out, I spied the Grand Forge! Perhaps, `also, a way to escape this madness. There must `a key around here somewhere! On the beasts `perhaps. Even fragments which I could piece `together would do. I shall have to face great`evil once more. Gods be with me once more.	18
Nodfod6	Day 55` I have made my way past many locked doors and` encountered great hordes of evil. The forge`is here. Unfortunately I have learned that the `dagger is fragmented in the crypt. I lost much`in here. My good friend and along with him the `shard which may be a piece to a larger puzzle, `the khukri, Greenmist. I could never get that `back. I would need to speak with the Brood and `obtain a Crusader Coffin. But should I return to`Cabilis without the dagger, Qyzar would torture `me. No! Here shall be my last stand!`	18

nurglestone1	The goblins of the pickclaw`tribe were not known for`their wit. In fact, because`of their extreme lack of`intelligence, they have been`abused in trades by just`about every merchant in`Norrath. If one were to`wonder why the citizens of`Highkeep permit the clan to`live in the mines beneath`their homes, the answer is`quite simple, they are good`miners and they trade the`ores cheaply.``The goblins would slave day`in and day out looking for`the "shiny rocks" for which`the stupid humans gave`them coin. The fact that`these same rocks actually`made the coin is a feature`that has escaped them`thus far.``In addition to the humans of`Highkeep, the goblins also`make secret trades with both`the Teir'Dal of Neriak and`the Koada'Dal of Faydwer.`The Teir'Dal would reward`the goblins with decent arms`and generally paid the best.`They were dangerous to deal`with as they were just as`likely to kill you as pay`you.  Trading with the`Koada'Dal was rather`uncommon. The Koada'Dal`only came seeking the few`rare stones they used to`create their arcane runes,`which was fine for the`pickclaws as no one else`wanted those dull looking`rocks.``The pickclaw miner Nurgal`was on par intellectually`with of the rest his clan.`Nurgal was quite happy this`day as he had found a new`vein in his section of the`mines. In fact, he'd already`pulled three shiny yellow`bricks today and was sure`to get at least a fistful of`copper for them!  After`chipping a few more layers`he hit something very hard`with his pick, so hard that`his pick bent.  ``"Whaza!" he exclaimed.  ``In the crevice he revealed`was a slightly glowing blue`rock.  "Hmm," he thought,`"me never seen a blue rock`afore."  He tried chipping`at a little bit more but`could not even put a scratch`into it.  Finally in a`display of rare brilliance,`and after ruining several`more tools, he decided to`carve around the rock and`yank it out.``The rock was spherical in`shape, about 8 inches in`diameter.  Nurgal's eyes`gleamed with a dull brilliance`as he guessed how many`allies he could buy with`this rare find.`He quickly concealed`it in his belt pouch, wary as`always that some of the`larger goblins might see it`and take it from him.  He`quickly scrambled out of the`hole he was working in and`started off to the city to`find the dark elf ambassador.`The dark elves had always`given Nurgal the best prices`for rare finds, and this`would be no exception he`decided.`	0
nurglestone2	Tyrana Slil was quite pleased`with Nurgal, especially since`he swore that he brought this`new find straight to her`without telling anyone else.`As one of the Teir'Dal`ambassadors in Highkeep, it`was Tyrana's job to be both`spy and broker for materials`gained in the keep.  Although`Tyrana enjoyed the dark end`of her work, she really`wanted to be back in Neriak.`Working with these lesser`races day in and day out`was, after all, beneath her`standards. She thought, "And`thanks to this stupid`creature, I may just have a`ticket back there."``"So, u pay me big?" he asked`with a disgustingly lustful`gaze.``"Sweet sweet Nurgal, you've`been so kind to me, how can`I ever repay you? More wine?"`Gods how she hated having to`play the role of seductress`to this loathsome creature,`but nevertheless, her tactics`were effective. Nurgal gulped`the wine, most of which ended`up on his gut, and seemed`most pleased with himself.`"Now, let us see just what`kind of properties this find`of yours has." ``She had the orb centered on`the table, although she was`not the most practiced`geologist, as a necromancer`of Innoruuk she did have`some powerful identification`spells at her disposal.  As`she finished her minor`enchantment there was a`bright flash of blue light`and a burning sensation that`caused her to jump back,`shrieking.  Nurgal promptly`jumped under the table`wanting no part of the dark`elf's wrath that was sure to`follow.  ``But instead of draining`Nurgal's life as she stared`at her now burnt fingertips,`Tyrana begin to cackle with`unabashed glee.  "By`Innoruuk's hand this is no`mere metal! Its magic`properties alone are the`strongest I've seen!"`Realizing that his mistress`was happy again Nurgal pulled`himself up from the floor`and smiled.  "Nurgal. Are`there more of these where`you found this one, in the`mines?" she asked.  ``"Umm, me not know,but`usually when me find one`type of shiny rock me find`more later," he replied.  ``"I must get both this rock`and this information to`Neriak at once," Tyrana`thought to herself,  "But,`before I leave, I must have`this wretched creature show`me where he found this, so`I can be done with him."``After Nurgal was appropriately`intoxicated, Tyrana tried to`convince the goblin to show`her where it was he found`this vein of strange blue ore.`Nurgal was hesitant to reveal`the location of his find to`the dark elf but after Tyrana`offered him a sizeable`reward, the goblin finally`agreed. Calling for a guard`from the keep to escort them,`Tyrana followed Nurgal down`into the mines where he`revealed the location of the`strange blue vein of ore.``Tyrana was very pleased with`Nurgal's find and`complimented the goblin`on a job well done.`After inspecting the vein of`ore, Tyrana turned to the`goblin and grinned, her hands`began to glow with a pale`green light.``Nurgal jumped in fear as the`magic began to swirl and`build around Tyrana. The`coarse hair on the goblin's`body began to bristle with`the building energy. Ducking`his head, Nurgal blathered,`"What you doing, You not`hurt Nurgal now?"``Tyrana continued to smile at`the goblin and said in a`sweet voice, "Why Nurgal!`I'm not going to hurt you,`I'm simply creating your`reward!" No sooner had the`Teir'Dal uttered these words`did she draw away the full`sum of Nurgal's lifeforce.`With a pitiful squeal, the`goblin slumped to the ground,`a dry and empty husk.`Tyrana laughed.`	0
nurglestone3	Concealing the large blue`sphere in her packs she`prepared to journey back to`Neriak to report of her find.`Tyrana sought out Grigog,`Bgug, Saag, and Glunn a`group of Orcs of the`Shralok clan.`Tyrana often used these four`as escorts for her journeys`between Neriak and Highkeep.`Though she always paid the`orcs well for their services,`they were always willing to`help protect "bootifal"`Tyrana Slil and likely would`do the job free of charge. ``Grigog was the leader of the`mercenaries, slightly bigger`then the others and a rather`powerful shaman to boot.`Bgug was the most`demented of the Orcs`and delighted in the torture`of his already dead`opponents. He would usually`cut small openings into`different parts of the body`trying to guess the identity`of certain anatomical parts.`He would do this until Grigog`kicked him in the back of`the head, breaking his`morbid trance.``Saag was easily one of the`biggest and dumbest orcs in`the lands. He was utterly`useless when given`complicated orders but`once someone gave`him a target it was assured`that it would stand no more,`be it human or inanimate`object. When not fighting he`enjoyed staring into empty`space and drooling. Glunn`was another matter altogether.`He was as happy-go-lucky as`an orc could be. He was`celebrating his 12th birthday`but because he could not`remember exactly when he`was born, he had been`celebrating his birthday for`several days now and planned`to continue celebrating it`for a few more, just to be`safe.``Tyrana was very good at`ignoring the orcs. She cared`only that they were strong`fighters and were fiercely`loyal to her. They proved`their usefulness to her once`again that day.``The group met with some`minor resistance along their`way to Neriak, in the form`of some humans that`assumed the worst upon`seeing a dark elf being`escorted by a group`of rather large orcs. Saag`and Glunn were left behind`in the battle as the`remaining three slipped away`during the commotion. Saag`and Glunn were presumed to`have been slain during the`conflict. Tyrana could have`cared less for the sacrifice`of her protectors. From that`point onward, they moved`quickly as word spread of`their travels and further`resistance began. Tyrana`and the remaining orcs were`soon joined by other curious`Teir'Dal who, ever loyal to`their own, helped to drive`back the attackers.``With her now rather large`retinue of curious Teir'Dal`and others friendly to the`dark elven cause, they`arrived in Neriak Commons.`There, Tyrana met with`Laarthik K'Shin and they`proceeded to go to the Neriak`Academy of Lesser Magics.`She handed the stone to`Laarthik, whispering quietly`with him as the crowd of`onlookers looked on`curiously.`	0
nurglestone4	Turning the stone over in his`hand a few times, Laarthik`K'Shin looked to Tyrana and`said in a stern voice, "Very`well Tyrana. You may return`to Highpass at this time."``Shocked at being ordered back`to the place she disliked,`even in the face of this`momentous discovery, she`began to protest, "Surely you`will not send me back to the`den of humanity! The place`reeks of those sightless`fools and the filthy`creatures that war daily with`them! Does not my discovery`earn me the right to be freed`from such lowly duty?"``His face twisting in disgust,`Laarthik shot back, "Hold`your tongue woman before`I remove it from your head!`As a member of an`insignificant and non-noble`house, you have no 'right' to`anything! You will do as you`are told and be happy that`you are allowed to serve us."``Moving sharply, he wrote`upon a parchment with quick,`jagged motions. Thrusting the`parchment toward Tyrana, he`barked, "Here are your orders.`Leave me at once."``Removing a bag from his vest,`he scattered a pile of gold`coins upon the table behind`him and said, "Those loyal`brethren that wish to escort`Tyrana back to High Keep`may take their payment now."`Turning quickly, he marched`from the room.``Mouth agape, Tyrana stood in`shock for a moment. Then,`snarling to herself Tyrana`strode indignantly from the`Academy, her escorts`following close behind.``The Wood Elves are thought`by some, to be the least`active race on Norrath,`content with living their`lives in their beloved forest`fighting off the occasional`Orc incursion. This is far`from the truth however.`Tunare's Martyrs have many`operatives throughout Faydark`and Antonica, even keeping`one stationed in Erudin.`Felinin Deepwood was the`Highkeep operative and was`charged with keeping tabs on`the Teir'Dal actions within.`He was young for his rank`and eager to please his`superiors and Tunare. For`weeks his main target,`Tyrana, had done nothing but`buy various types of ore from`the goblins and make a few`shady deals with the local`Merchants. ``Word of Tyrana Slil's strange`and sudden journey to Neriak`convinced him that the`Teir'Dal were up to`something terrible. He`made the decision that`he would take action,`figure out what was going`on, and try to stop them.`He gathered those folk`in the area that were willing`to help stop the Teir'Dal`and began to lay plans`for an ambush. `	0
nurglestone5	Tyrana, Grigog, Bgug and the`few Teir'Dal escorts brave`enough to get close to the`human keep stepped into the`dark forest of Kithicor. Her`head still filled with rage`from Laarthik's cold rebuke,`Tyrana was taken by`surprise as Bgug slumped`to the ground, clutching`at the arrow in his back.`Her violet eyes wide`with terror, she shouted,`"Ambush! We are under`attack!"``Suddenly, the forest was`alive with arrows flying, the`sound of metal clanging`against metal. Everything was`electric as spells were`channeled and great`explosions erupted sending`lifeless bodies sailing`through the air. Drawing`forth her dagger, she faced`off with Felinin, a feral`snarl flashing across her`face.``Lunging forward to stab`the Wood Elf in the chest,`Felinin dodged easily and`slashed with his scimitar`seriously wounding`Tyrana's leg. Suddenly`fearful for her life, Tyrana`began to call upon the dark`art of Necromancy to steal`the precious life energy of`the Fier'Dal and heal her`grave wound. Felinin's`attacks were relentless and`the dark elf was not able to`channel forth the energy`necessary to complete her`spell. A final cruel blow to`her chest sent Tyrana Slil`reeling. Stumbling to the`ground gasping for breath,`she died.``Tyrana Slil defeated and her`escorts dead or fleeing for`their lives, Felinin`congratulated those that`helped him on a job well`done. Searching the now`lifeless body of the`Teir'Dal, he found the note`that had been given to Tyrana`from Laarthik. The note held`grave news for the citizens`of High Keep and indeed,`all of Antonica. The Teir'Dal`had decided it was time to`take High Keep as their own.``Wasting no time, Felinin made`his way to the keep and`delivered the grave news to`Lord Tephys, the High Elven`ambassador. Lord Tephys`was greatly concerned by`the news. Lord Tephys`called for a meeting of`the allied races at the`keep. Runners were`dispatched immediately`to all corners of the known`world, taking the news and`begging representatives to`attend this meeting of`serious importance.`	0

PAINHoleBk	Two hundred years after Erud`left the continent of Antonica`to establish Erudin on the`continent of Odus, our own`ancestors, who have been known`to some as Cazicites, grew in`power and knowledge of ancient`dark arts.  The`Erudites, once our brothers,`criticized us, persecuted us,`and eventually drove us out of`the city we had helped to`found.  So great was their`prejudice and unfounded anger`toward us that they attacked`us with terrible magics.``During the course of the con-`flict between us, our`erstwhile brothers barraged us`with ever larger and fiercer`blasts of magic.  Our own`magic being rather formidable`in and of itself, we were well`able to protect ourselves.`An unexpected result of the`collisions of many forms of`magic in a single location,`however, brought the Age of`Enlightenment, and our own`relations with the Erudites`to a crashing halt.``Tremendous magical energy`built in one spot until the`very air vibrated with its`power.  When it seemed that`the fabric of time and space`themselves could no longer`withstand the force, a great`explosion tore open the earth`with a blaze of light and a`torrent of sound!  A nearly`fathomless hole was rent in`the surface of Norrath leading`deep into the planet, almost`to the very Underfoot itself.`It was in this cavernous space`that we founded our city,`Paineel.	-1
PAINOldPainBk	The great city of Paineel was`created to serve as a refuge`and home base for us, the`Cazicites.  We, the practi-`tioners of the dark arts, who`were so wrongfully and uncere-`moniously ejected from our`homeland of Erudin, founded`the city in the great hole`blasted from the ground during`the civil war.  We carved our`city out of the`walls of that cavernous abyss`and created a haven in which`we had the freedom to seek`knowledge - our inalienable`right.``Our dark city, built with the`blackest of ebony and quartz`crystals, was seldom seen by`outsiders. Most visitors died`on the journey down or from`the sacrifice of blood`required for entry.  Our`center of safety and power,`unbeknownst to us, however,`faced a danger which would`eventually prove its undoing.``A mysterious area of rock`which, amazingly, seemed to`have a life of its own, was`found during excavations to`enlarge the city.  Its charac-`teristics, unfortunately, were`not observed until too late.`The damage done to that rock`by magical construction caused`another tremendous explosion,`loosing hordes of evil and`dangerous beasts from within.` Once again, our people fled`from certain extinction.	-1
PAINPainBk	Having fled from persecution`by our own kind, and then`forced to flee our beautiful`Paineel, we rebuilt our city`here, not far from its prede-`cessor.  New Paineel was`designed in the image of Old`Paineel, but has come to`outshine its namesake over`time.  Here, we Cazicites,`favored by Cazic-Thule, have`reached the epitome of know-`ledge and lore in the dark`arts.  No other necromancers`on the face of Norrath have`developed quite the skills we`have, here in the heart of`Cazic-Thule.``Necromancers from all over our`world come to beg training`from us.  Even the great`Miragul himself came here to`learn from us, though his own`motives turned out to have`been suspect.  It was here, in`the center of necromantic`learning, that he gained`enough of an understanding to`enable him to create undead`from a living being, though`his results were not quite as`he expected.``May Paineel stand as an inspi-`ration to those who would`spread disease and pestilence`throughout Norrath, an ever-`growing center of knowledge`and understanding.	-1

PAWNOTE8	Volume 4`History of the Verishe Mal``The Council of Nine has ruled`us faithfully for many a year`now.  We find peace in our`lives, and vow not to harm`another.  There are still many`factions that wish to return`to the old ways, but the`current council, has opposed`those ideas in chamber.`They suspect at this time`that there may be someone`working within the council to`return the Verishe to the`old ways.  This must not`happen at any cost.	15

POIAnizok1	September 27th`It has been nearly two weeks `since I have appeared in this `place.  I feel my mind wander `to places I have never seen.  `Thoughts of creations flow `freely.  I can't scribe fast `enough to keep up with the `devices that I picture.  It is`as if my mind feeds of the `very essence of this plane.  I`have never been so excited `with the thoughts that I have `been conjuring before, however`this place is a lonely one so `I keep this journal as my `companion.``Something that I would have `enjoyed using back home is the`Maximizing Device I have made.` There were many times when `visiting abroad that the `shelves were very unwelcoming `to gnomes.  The growing device`alters the body of the user to`make them increase in size.  `The Maximizing Device came `about by using a Base `Prototype that I would use for`future creations.  The Base `Prototype was created from `steel casing, pinion, grease, `and a ball bearing.  I took `the Base Prototype and used `gnomish bolts and sprockets `for the base motor.  I added a`class six battery to power the`whole engine.  I then added a `perpetual air pump.  After `much testing I have found that`the machine will harmlessly `increases the size of the `body.``On the other side of the gear `I created a device that would `allow me to shrink down to the`smallest size and go into `holes as small as a mouse.  To`make the Minimizing Device I `used all the same ingredients `as the Maximizing Device but `used a perpetual steam pump `instead.  Many tests with this`item show it to be harmless to`the body as well.`	8
POIAnizok2	October 18th`Lately even though my mind has`become focused on projects `that I work on, my body has `become clumsier.  I seem to `cut my fingers on the gears as`I place them.  I set about to `make a gauze press so I could `bandage up the many cuts that `I have endured.  The gauze `press is an amazing invention `I must say.  I took one `bandage and added it to the `machine and it constantly `produces new fresh bandages.  `I took a base prototype and `added gnomish bolts, a static `orb, and a class six battery `to keep all the gears in `motion.``I have started to create new `form of clockwork that puts `those in Ak'Anon to shame.  `Their intelligence grows `constantly.  Their perpetual `learning ability is amazing.  `I have no fear of them `surpassing me though.  I feel `like my mind's power has moved`beyond any gnome before.``The clockwork work tirelessly.` Within a few short weeks they`have created a massive factory`to further the production of `themselves.  They continue to `build better versions of `themselves, and discard those `that are obsolete.  Those that`are discarded eventually run `out of power in the junkyard. `I go out and collect parts `from these left behind models `for inventions that keep `coming to mind.`	8
POIAnizok3	November 23rd`I have run low on parts `lately.  I have to constantly `scour the junkyard for useable`parts.  It is odd that when a `clockwork stops working `completely I can track it as `if it was a deceased creature `of nature.  The mana that `powers the clockwork must `leave behind a residual aura `as if it was alive.  I have `since made a Necrotic Diving `Device that allows me to more `accurately track the remains `of the clockwork that has `fallen.  To make the device I `used all the same items as I `did for the gauze press but `used a Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin`instead of bandages as the `focus of the machine.  The `necrotic power of the Jade `Coffin helps the Divining `power of the machine.``Believe it or not, I got lost `in the junkyard yesterday.  I `spent a long time collecting `springs and gears and lost `track of the time.  It got `dark and I could not tell `which direction was which.  I `had left my trusty compass `back on my dresser because I `did not expect to be out so `long.  I had to sleep out in `the scrap metal last night.  `This morning I finally got my `bearings and headed back to my`workshop.  I decided to place `the compass into my `breastplate that I wear out `while collecting materials `(some of the clockwork have `gotten quite aggressive).  I `took my gnomish compass and `attached it to a coiled `spring.  I then attached that `spring to my steel `breastplate.  I created a `switch mechanism that `automates the compass to come `out for easy viewing, the only`extra thing I needed was a `steel ball bearing to allow `the switch to move from on to `off.  A class six mana battery`is required to keep the switch`and automated motors `constantly working.` `While out in the junkyard I `got tired of lugging around `the huge toolbox that I own `for simple tasks.  I decided `to form a new toolbox that is `more portable.  I placed a `toolbox mold, high quality `brick of ore, metal bit, and a`flask of water into a forge `and made a nice small toolbox `that was a lot easier to carry`around.`	8
POIAnizok4	December 8th`Out of curiosity I decided to `create something that a friend`of mine back in Ak'Anon would `have found useful.  He was a `rogue by trade, and we had `many adventures together.  I `remember one time in `particular we went to `Freeport, I think I was `selling some basic tinkered `items I had made.  He was `doing something he wouldn't `tell me about.  We were `staying at this inn that had a`locked door that he seemed `preoccupied with gaining `access to.  He did a lot of `planning, timing guards `passing by, checking how often`the chambermaid would come `through to check on the rooms.` `He asked for my help and we `sprang into action near `midnight!  He snuck quietly `down the hallway, making sure `not to cause the wooden floor `to creak (which had earlier in`the day).  He was quite `stealthy, I watched from the `end of the hall to let him `know if anyone was coming.  `Once he got to the door he `reached deep into his pocket. `He then pulled out… Nothing!  `He had forgotten his lockpicks`back in Ak'Anon.  I tell you, `he was furious.  I had never `seen and never would see him `so red in the face again.`So I decided to make a set of `mechanized lockpicks that fit `into a pair of gloves.  I took`a pair of Chainmail gloves, `and attached a device to the `top of it.  I took a set of `mechanical lock picks and `attached them to the gloves `with a pinion.  To set the `switch on the gloves I used a `coiled spring and a ball `bearing.  It uses a class six `mana battery to keep it in `constant working order.  I am `sure that he would have liked `to have had these gloves back `on that hot summer night in `Freeport.`	8
POIAnizok5	January 25th`An item of necessity that I `have created is a weather `firework.  The rain here is `acidic at times and burns the `skin.  I have used a concept `taught to me by the Elves of `Greater Faydark.  Calling on `Karana they can cease the rain`somehow with the use of an `opal.  I placed an opal on a `normal Firework and then used `an Advanced Propulsion Unit to`send it up to the sky.  Firing`the firework up to the clouds `it explodes with the attached `opal.  The opal dust from the `explosion spreads out among `the clouds and the rain ceases`for a period of time that is `undeterminable.  It is useful `when you need to finish up `what you are working on `quickly and get inside out of `the corrosive rain.  The APU `was made from spare parts that`I had laying around; a `tinkered catapult, firewater, `coiled spring, and saltpeter.``While fooling around with the `meteorological rocket, I made `another.  Some of the `clockworks have started to `attack me while out collecting`materials.  it seems that they`are easily startled by loud `sounds.   So I made a rocket `as I did with the `meteorological rocket but used`saltpeter instead of an opal. `The effect is a very loud `explosion that does minimal `damage but is enough to ward `away the attacking rogue `clockworks.``Using a telescope I spied on `something that I thought was `quite amazing today.  Another `gnome appeared.  He is dressed`in some plate mail that I have`not ever seen before.  Many `scrapes are on it and lots of `scars can be seen on his face.` He spoke to the clockwork `without fear of them.  I think`that he has made some sort of `agreement with them.  I am not`sure what is being created in `the factory but it is churning`all hours of the night.  `Louder and more quickly than `it ever has.  I believe that I`will start my new creation `tommorow.  A sort of `protection just in case all of`these clockwork decide to turn`on me.  For today I shall `finish my ultimate creation.	8
POIAnizok6	February 21st`Success, my invention is `working perfe    `             `ctly.  I cannot `remember feeling better than I`do right now.  I shall start `on my protection today.  `Nezmirthafen shall be the name`of it.  Clockwork dragon it `shall be.`	0

PoisonsLost	During my stay here in the`Lake of Ill Omen with the`Erud anthropologist I have`acquired quite an exotic`collection of poisonous herbs`and venomous materials.``Using a SEALED POISON VIAL`and LARENT SUSPENSION I have`added the contents of two`HEARTSTING VENOM SACKS and`produced a poison that has`paralyzing effects.``With a LINED POISON VIAL and`CONSTRICT SUSPENSION I have`added CINDER HORNET POLLEN`and ASH HORNET VENOM.

POITabben1	Tabben Bromal Research Notes `Volume I.`- - - - - - - - - - - - - -`For my beloved, I begin this `journal. You see, she spends `many days out in the meadows `creating artwork, sewing `dresses, and enjoying the `outdoors. She is a true `artisan. Her current sewing `kit is quite bulky, so I have `been inspired to create a more`portable way for her to be `able to enjoy her craft. I `have created a container, `which at the desire of the `user, will compact onto itself`and fit nicely into any `backpack. I achieved this by `taking a handful of metal `bits. I pressed them into the `thimble, needle, container `base, and container lid molds `that I purchased from the `blacksmith down the road. Once`the thimble, needle, `container, and lid were `complete, I took some gnomish `bolts to rivet the container `together in a fashion that it `could be collapsed. I then `took a coiled spring to attach`the lid to the container. She `was very pleased with the kit,`and uses it every time she `goes out to sew.  My friend `Klen saw her unfolding the `sewing kit for use and seemed `very interested. He offered a `months supply of his wonderful`cheese if I would make him `one, but so that he could use `it to mix ingredients to cook `with while out camping in the `wild. Being a fond lover of `cheese I took him up on his `offer and got to work! Making `the collapsing bowl was easier`than the sewing kit. All I had`to do was take four folded `sheets of metal (I am becoming`a regular customer of the `blacksmiths it seems) and `rivet them together with some `gnomish bolts. I then took a `coiled spring and attached it `so that the bowl will compact `on itself more easily. The `four metal sheets then spread `out very nicely to form a bowl`shape for Klen to work with.	0
POITabben2	Tabben Bromal`Research Notes Volume II.`- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`Klen loved the bowl so much `that he offered me one more `deal.  He would offer wine to `go with the cheese if I would `make him a spit that he could `travel with easier.  He is a `true outdoorsman and loves to `cook what he can find from the`land.  The collapsible spit `was fairly easy to make.  I `took three metal rods and `bolted them together with some`gnomish bolts.  I then took a `coiled spring and attached it `along the bottom of the middle`rod so that collapsing was `automatic.  I then took a set `of skewers and attached them `to the side of the rod for `convenience of cooking.  I do `say, that the wine he has `chosen goes quite nicely with `the cheese.``After all this hard work, I `decided to make something for `myself!  You see I am quite `fond of the outdoors as well. `I enjoy the relaxation that `fishing affords.  However I do`not enjoy the cumbersome `toolbox that I currently have.` I need to take it to hold and`create lures while out on the `lake, but I would like one `that would fit into my pocket.` Looking back on how I made `the collapsible sewing kit I `used the same ingredients to `make me a tackle box.  The `only difference is that I left`out the Thimble, and Needle.``I had my best catch ever with `my new tacklebox.  It opens `easily any time I need it.  `Fish, wine, and cheese.

PondPaladin1	From Pond to Paladin`              Or`      The Origins of`     Froglok and Man`              by`Glupurp Stoneskipper`     Paladin of Marr```My noble kinsman, I bring`to you the knowledge or our`origins, as well as the`origin of Man that has been`bestowed upon me by the`scholars of the City of New`Tanaan, and those who have`visited the Halls of Honor,`home of our Lord Mithaniel`Marr. I am but a humble`Paladin of Mithaniel Marr,`born like many of our kind`in the swamps of Southern`Antonica, and deserve no`adulation for penning these`words.  This work is in`honor of all Froglok,`current, past, and yet to`come.``In the early ages of`Norrath, before the arrival`of Man, the Marr Twins did`walk the face of Norrath.`The children of a God of`Power, Tarrew Marr the Water`Lord, the Marr Twins`searched amongst the mortals`of Norrath a cause to`champion and embrace with`their divinity. The Gods of`Nature puzzled over the Marr`Twins absence of a divine`purpose, and the Gods of`Influence scoffed at the`twins for seeking such a`purpose amongst the`mortals. The most malicious`of the Gods, Innoruuk, and`Cazic-Thule, sought to`corrupt the young twins to`strengthen the forces of`hatred and fear.``Innoruuk, the twisted God`of Hatred and Spite sent`his mortal followers to`Tarrews daughter, Erollisi`Marr, to tempt her and`seduce her into the`darkness. With the wisdom`imparted to the Goddess by`her father, she saw through`the Teir'Dals deceptions,`and their wickedness was`more visible to her eyes`than even their physical`forms. So it came to pass`that Erollisi journeyed to`the lands of Tunare's fair`elves, to escape the`sickening advances of the`Teir'Dal. It was in the`early kingdoms of the elves,`that Erollisi did find`warmth, peace, and beauty`in the harsh realm of the`mortals and it was there`that she embraced and was`in return embraced by a`most mortal of traits. It`was there she found love.``While Erollisi fended off`the advances of Innoruuks`mortal agents, the forces of`Cazic-Thule beset her twin`brother, Mithaniel Marr.`Serpents, phantoms, and all`manner of frightful creatures`conjured and commanded by`Cazic-Thules mortal minions`came to Mithaniel to assault`his body and mind. Mithaniel`was no mortal however, and`his will is strong, the`minions of Thule could not`instill within him the fear`of their dark lord. They did`succeed however, in luring`the brave Mithaniel to the`swamps of Norrath, the`deadly, dank, lands where`the creatures of Cazic-Thule`were the strongest and most`numerous. An army of`Trolls, Lizard Folk, and`forgotten creatures of`unspeakable horror beset`Mithaniel Marr, and so it`came to pass that he became`a captive to the minions of`the Lord of Fear.``Mithaniel, imprisoned in`magical bonds provided to`his captors by Cazic-Thule,`and tortured by relentless`monstrosities, prayed to his`father day and night for`forgiveness and salvation.`The prayers continued,`unanswered, until the brave`God, weary from torture`and weakened by the dark`magic of Cazic-Thule fell`into a deep slumber.``It was then that Terris-Thule`visited the slumbering God`to inflict his sleep with`nightmares more horrible`than the events he had`endured at the hands of`his captors during his`waking hours. However, at`the beseeching of her father,`Cazic-Thule, Terris was not`permitted to inflict such`terror onto Mithaniel Marr`until after she first`deceived him through his`dreams and stole the gift of`life from his body. So Terris`did as her father commanded`and then the slumbering`horrors began.`	13
PondPaladin2	`Morell-Thule, the forsaken`son of Cazic, and brother of`Terris, took notice of Terris`manipulations of the`slumbering God, for while`Terris is the Queen of`Nightmares, Morell is the`King of Dreams. For reasons`unknown, perhaps simply to`foul the plans of his wicked`father and sister,`Morell-Thule stole the gift`of life that had been taken`from the slumbering`Mithaniel and escaped into`his Demi-Plane of Dreams.`Knowing that his enraged`family would soon visit his`home, Morell divided`Mithaniels Gift of Life,`scattering one half across`all the swamps of Norrath,`the sacred lands of his`father, Cazic-Thule.` `Where Mithaniels Gift of`Life fell upon the swamps`of Norrath, the first Froglok`Tads were born. Those first`Tads had the hardest trials`of our people. Until that`point, the swamps belonged`only to the foul and`destructive creatures of the`dark gods. Fortunately the`gift of life that had brought`our first ancestors into`being also empowered them`with the bravery and valor`Mithaniel Marr had`exhibited during his trials`in the mortal realms.``Once the swamps had been`seeded with the first of our`kind, the Lord of Dreams,`Morell-Thule, visited`Mithaniel Marr's twin`sister, Erollisi Marr. While`the Goddess of Love`blissfully rested in the`lands of the fair elves,`Morell-Thule visited her in`a dream and gave to her the`second half of Mithaniel's`Gift of Life. It was soon to`be evident to the fair elves`that their visiting daughter`of the Gods was with child`and they took her to an`uninhabited region of the`frozen northlands of`Antonica, where they could`tend to and guard her in`seclusion.``While the elves watched`after Erollisi, the first of`our ancestors grew from`Tads into adult Frogloks,`and Morell-Thule gifted`them with dreams of the`imprisoned Mithaniel Marr,`and visions of a means to`free the brave son of`Tarrew. So it came to pass`that from all the swamps of`Norrath, the first Frogloks`rose in arms against the`minions of Cazic-Thule,`fighting valiantly to the`site of Mithaniel Marrs`imprisonment, guided by`visions from the Lord of`Dreams.``For uncounted years the`Frogloks battled the evil`inhabitants of Norraths`swamplands, learning the`lessons of both victory and`defeat. Alas, Cazic-Thule`is an ancient and powerful`God and his minions are`numerous and diverse. Try`as they might, the ancestor`Frogloks could not reach`their imprisoned God, but`never did they cease their`efforts, despite the`daunting odds.``Then, after some time, a`small army arrived on the`borders of the swamp that`was Mithaniel Marrs prison.`Not an army of Frogloks,`but an army of Northmen,`the children of Erollisi`Marr. They too had been`guided by visions and dreams`of the imprisoned God from`whose life they were`conceived. Seeking justice`for the imprisonment of their`father, the Northmen joined`with the Froglok armies and`the alliance of Froglok and`Man succeeded in freeing`their father Mithaniel Marr.`The minions of Cazic-Thule`and the Avatar of Fear`himself fell before the`unity and valor of the`children of Marr. For the`first time in the history of`Norrath, the swamps were`not safe for the evil`creations of the dark gods.``It was in the brave and`selfless actions of the`ancestor Frogloks and`Northmen that Mithaniel`Marr discovered the mortal`trait of Valor, and because`of Morell-Thule's honorable`delivering of the truth of`our origins to our ancestors`in visions and dream,`Mithaniel also chose to`champion the virtue of`honesty as well as valor.``Such is the tale of my`Lord Mithaniel Marr, and`the origins of my fellow`Frogloks, and of our distant`brethren, the race of Men.`It is a shame that so many`of our kind, as well as`many of the race of men,`have strayed from the`virtues of our ancestors.`May Mithaniel Marr bless`us, his faithful servants,`with the powers to redeem`our fallen kin from the`clutches of evil.`	13
PoPfirstvision	The First Vision``Hidden in the bowels of`Night Keep in the early days`of Grobb lay a tunnel`leading to a small cave.`No torches donned the walls`of this place and a small`wooden altar was the only`object within.`Those initiated into the`order of shadowknights in`Night Keep knew this place`as The Eyes of Cazic.`It was here that the Warlord`Grimgash, after he and the`Warlord Jurglash completed`their clan's victory over the`residents of Innothule swamp`came to give thanks to Cazic`Thule for their dominance.`After three days of`disciplined meditation in`this chamber with neither`food nor drink Grimgash`received a vision from the`Lord of Fear. Through his`mind he foresaw a great order`of disciplined troll warriors`mixing their natural fighting`skills with the dark powers`of Cazic Thule, spreading`terror throughout the swamps`of Innothule and beyond.`Grimgash ordered a keep built`around the cave. Thus began`the order now called the`Shadowknights of Night Keep.`The newly initiated troll`shadowknights under Warlord`Grimgash were sent into`this cavern to receive a`vision from Cazic Thule`thus setting the path of`their destiny.`Through the guidance of`the visions granted by The`Eyes of Cazic Thule, the`shadowknights of Night`Keep led several successful`campains against the Frogloks`of Guk. The eyes revealed to`Cazic's faithful trolls the`hiding places of the Frogloks`and the Frogloks advances on`Grobb before they came to`pass.`As the years passed and the`swamps rose beneath Grobb,`water and sludge began to`swallow The Eyes of Cazic`Thule. The shadowknights of`Night Keep tried to keep the`swamp at bay but eventually`the cavern became`submerged beneath Grobb,`The Eyes of Cazic Thule`lost to the new generations`of Shadowknights.`Without the influence of The`Eyes of Cazic Thule, the`Teir'Dal of Neriak found it`easier to persuade young`trolls into the service of`Innoruuk, and Night Keep`became an army divided`between two Gods. It is`whispered in the shadows of`Night Keep that should one`of Cazics faithful reach The`Eyes of Cazic Thule beneath`the waters and sludge of the`swamp and survive, they`shall become the mightiest`of all shadowknights and`shall lead Grobb in victories`unparalleled by the great`warlords of days gone by.	6
PoPSteins	I had the unfortunate `occassion to run into a wee `bit of trouble in my youth, `most particularly while `spending time drowning my `sorrows at the local pub.  The`story I share now from those `days is one of mystery, for I `never did learn who it was `that shared with me the `knowledge to craft my very own`special stein.`After talking through the `night of politics and `adventures, the mysterious `stranger finally told me`of his trade secret, which I `furiously etched into a nearby`piece of wood (the only `writing material I could `scrounge in that egregous `dive).````He instructed me to collect `the following:`       a Block of Tanaan Clay`       Tainted Planar Essence`       Ceramic Lining Sketch`       a Water Flask`       Sculpting Tools``I was then to use them with a `Tanaan pottery wheel to create`a base model stein.``He then spoke of Crystalline `Valor Glaze, supposedly made `from Glaze Lacquer and some `Valor Crystals.  I was to `crush and mix them together in`a glaze mortar.``Then I was to find a Tanaan `kiln and place inside my base `model stein, the glaze, a High`Quality Firing Sheet, and a `Lacquered gem.  The type of `gem used determines the type `of stein you will produce, he `said, and that I could choose `from pearls, peridots, opals, `or star rubies.``Before I could explain to him `I could not afford such `materials after spending a `month's pay at the tavern, he `was gone.  I often wonder who `he really was.	0

I wish that I could say I have learned more about the Recuso in my time here, but even looking and acting like one of them when I arrived, there was no welcoming, no apparent sympathy.  One might expect that those in straits as dire as these would band together, that a sense of camaraderie would prevail, but that has not proven to be the case.  Instead, it is more necessary tolerance, barely restarined disgust at one another.	0

I don't know what it was,`but the hair on my feet grew `before my eyes.  I got very `hungry and I noticed that `there were many things running`around that looked a bit like `the mangler but they were `standing up, running around `and biting people? `WEREWOLVES!!!  I had to run `before one of them got to me `and maybe it was the new hair `on my feet (or the new hair on`my arms, or on my chest? or `the claws, I am not sure) but `my little legs were carrying `me faster than ever before.  I`ran to the tunnel where people`were gathered.  Well when I `arrived, they suddenly got `very quiet and started staring`at me (they must have heard of`me from my famous Muck Soup `recipe).  I think maybe they `thought that I would stop the `werewolves- ME?!?  I opened my`mouth to speak and they `started running away `screaming.  A werewolf must `have been right behind me, but`I wouldn't know because I ran `too, right up a tree.  I never`climbed a tree so fast in my `life, don't ask me to do it `again because I don't know how`I did it the first time.  It `was from up in this tree that `I realized that I could smell `Boomba's shop from there (must`have been the winds).  Well `that was too much for me and I`headed straight to for those `pickles.  Then someone shouted`something about killing one of`the werewolves and everyone `changing back, so nothing `really happened on the way `home.  Oh, and I made extra `steaks if anyone needs one."``So be careful out there `everyone, you never know what `might happen.`	0

ROGEP2BookTranslate	The manufacturing of a hay`golem is not so complex,`save for the creation of`the most important part:`the head. The process`requires a precise set of`ingredients, such that any`exclusion or imitation of a`crucial item can lead to`disastrous results.`When combined with care,`the resulting head can`simply be fitted into the`frame of the hay golem with`no need for spells or`further transmutation.`For the husk, you must`locate a fitting carved`pumpkin. Such can often by`found in Estates teeming`with the undead. While`this place will feel`somewhat foreboding, there`is no better place to`harvest this item. Next,`seek out a supplemental`shapely vegetation. The`best bet is a dank and`moist fungus filled region.`Thirdly on the list are`stringy vines. The best`vines I have found are`located on the moon of`Luclin in the mad mage's`domain. This is why`stealth is of the utmost`importance.`Next, there is a need for`several fragments of the`unliving: The claw of an`ancient dragon, long dead.`Tattooed skin peeled from a`zombie - I imagine there`are many bloated sailors`that would not miss a scrap`of their flesh. Tears of`those spirits that are long`forgotten.`The final elements are the`most important, and oddly`enough, the most difficult`to find. The basking glow`of an orange flame, a`living essence of a dancing`mote of light. These wisps`are typicallly found in`swamplands. Also, the`boiling liquid from the`Mistress' laboratory.`Lastly, the reanimation`formula.`Unfortunately, in all my`travels I was never able to`find the source of this`substance and all my`attempts to duplicate it`have been for naught. I`have often debated whether`the extra efforts required`for this endeavor are worth`my time. Since the first`time I laid eyes upon a hay`golem, I knew the knowledge`of their creation would be`mine ... someday.	0

RokNilok	The Crusades of 1312   `  This was the time of the `scattered and defeated Iksar`empire. The great dragon,`Trakanon and his allies of`scale had left the empire`in rubble and our people were`divided yet again. The once`grand city of Sebilis was`claimed by the one who `decimated it.`  The remaining Iksar were`scattered among the outlands`of Kunark. Their places of `refuge were now the dwellings of`dark denizens. In the wilds`a few castes came to unite.`One of these was the `remnants of the Crusaders`of Greenmist. They were led`by a powerful shadowknight`named Rok Nilok. ``  The army of shadowknights`numbered in the hundreds. `Within their ranks were a few`mystics and legionnaires. `The tribe named itself after`their leader,`The Crusaders of Rok`Nilok, and they would purge`the lands of Kunark. ```` The Crusaders burned across`the Dreadlands and death`came quickly to those who`dared stand in their way.`They slew many giants and `many goblins. There would be`no prisoners or slaves. The`empire shall be rebuilt by`the hands of the Iksar. All`others shall perish. ``` Karnor's Castle was the first`major objective of the `Crusaders. It had been`taken over by a goblin clan.`The goblins would soon find`themselves under siege. For `twenty days they held ground`until the Crusaders chose`to assault as a band of `goblin deserters fled. `A swift battle ensued and `the castle was reclaimed.` The Crusaders then set`their sights on the city`of Cabilis. While the march`was designed Rok Nilok `discovered something very`evil. Nothing is known of`his discovery. No record`exists of its evil. All `that is known is that Rok`Nilok made a pact and soon`shall suffer for it.``During the battle for Cabilis`a strange rain fell which`shrunk them to the size of`dolls and their heads were set`aflame. Nilok's head burned`red and the goblins squashed`the would be emperor and his`minions.`	18

RozzPlan	In order to make this weapon, the finest Frontier Ore must first be found.  Since the dagger is magical, one must first get the magical component specifically needed for completion.  The frontier ore is said to be found within the mines filled with the warring Goblins.  Some Goblins keep it close to them.  The magical component needed is the gem of nimbleness.  Once the two items are found, there is only one that has the talent to successfully make the weapon.  His name is Dapper Blackhammer.   He is known to frequent the area around Kaladim.

One of `note is the Constitutional - `ye Gods, what a drink!``The locals tell me that it's `made from essence of magic!  `They add soda water,  some `fermented yarrow, two local `fungi, then pop it all into a `bottle!  With a corking device`and a cork each time, it stays`fresh for an age!  My bottle `lasted me all the way through `the week!``I found that mixing yarrow and`water makes an excellent `fermentation.  Earthy!``The best corking devices, sad `to say, I buy from the gnomes.`Grobb -`What a hike!  I was met with `the usual hostility, which `included a real stomach-shaker`of a brew!  If you're `squeamish, maybe ye might want`to avoid the Liquid Meat they `drink down there.``Soda water, cask (and corked `thankfully!), malt and then `three juiced up meats!  `My host used gator, rat and `snake; he seemed to find `mandrake and acid was all it `took to "release dem `flavourz", on each meat.``It sounds vile, but it tastes `grand!`````Oggok -`Bags packed, off to the `Oggies!  The Triple Bile was `my favourite: putrid, `underbulk and skyash bile, all`swirled together in a poison `vial!  Ye can't say they don't`warn ye!

That glue is the `bones of the thunder salmon, `baked with water - really `sticky too!``With the airtight container `made, they mix in Surefall Sap`and magic essence and the `drink is ready!``To accompany -`I met a fellow traveller `whilst in Surefall, a little `lady who seemed to be fond of `cooking.  A nice halfling girl`- smelled of cabbage, but she `cooked up a storm!``One dish we ate was a seafood `salad - arctic mussels, small `clams, king crabs,  scallops, `rock crab, abalone and `vegetables all lightly cooked `in an oil made from something `called a Dragon Bay Snapper!``To follow we had a huge fish `pie!  I had to have a good `sleep after that!  It was a `weary-wrass-in-cream filling, `with a bit of dough, all `cooked in a special pot.``She said that the pot was made`from a pie tin sketch, large `block of clay, splash of water`and some funny dark clay.  She`was talking some nonsense `about getting that from `creatures made entirely of `clay and mud - hah!  Women!``Don't ask me how to make the `filling to that pie, I don't `know much about fish!  Except `the bad smell, curse 'em all!`To finish -`I caught the ferry over to `Erudin, and sampled a `delightful tipple therein!``Soda water, some sea horse `eggs, a little magical essence`and some greengill juice, all `mixed into a bottle and `corked.  The juice comes from `baking greengill bones with `water!  Delicious!	9

RWTLbf2	Nine offerings were made to `  the Powers,`Each symbolising toil of `  mortal hours;`Three times three, created by `  mortals,`Burned at once, in the Grove `  between portals.`Three given by Elvenkind `  fair,`Delicate offerings worked with`  care;`Three from noble Humanity's `  kin,`Each festive creation ushered `  in,`And Three from Karana's `  favoured race,`Fitting tributes to their `  Lord's smiling face.`First came the priests from `  Elven lands,`Their three gifts held in `  whitened hands...`There came a tall elf named `  Silvered Tree`Carrying a bottle, bigger even`  than me!`Of workmanship it was most `  refined`The jewelled bottle well `  defined.`The bottle itself was first `  created,`From magical gold, with opal `  mated,`With a glass bottle, by `  jeweller skilled.`What gorgeous craft with drink`  to be filled.`Once bottle crafted, now came `  the brew:`Using the magnum, wine yeast `  and double grapes too,`With a little soda water mixed`  to taste`Not a drop of liquid gone to ` waste.`With these fine ingrediants `  five,`The result was a champagne for`  which to strive!`In order to mix the soda `  water,`Ye should seek out Mudhand's `  daughter.`Thus water and soda should ye `  simply mix,`To produce more fizz than `  fizzlepops six!`The elves do brew in varying `  strengths,`Adding more or less grapes, `  such lengths!`However, this drink requires `  grapes just two,`Though using one or three can `  taste fine too!`With gift upon the fire `  overturned, `Back to the throng Silvered `  Tree returned.	20
RWTLbf3	Then came the second Elven `gift,`A sacred sickle with poise and`lift.`A smiling elf stepping out `  from the band,`Named Summer Sirocco, after `  warm wind's hand.`From three main parts were `  made his Sickle,`All forged together with `  hammer fickle.`First I must tell you of `  captured essence,`So that what follows makes `  more sense.`Across the worlds there are `  scattered,`Runes, words and other magicks`  mattered.`Here in the Fungus Caves can `  be found,`A Celestial Solvent, from `  Elf-girl bound.`Place a vial of this within a `  mortar,`And grind in rune, or word, `  without water.`The result is purest magic's `  flavour,`With many uses, ye shall `  savour.`One such use is in powder `  blessing:`Imbue the Elf-deity's gem with`  Tunarean tressing.`With this gem, and acid, and `  magical essence,`Fire in a kiln, to release the`  magical presence.`For each of the Sickle's three`  main parts,`The process is similar, say `  truest hearts:`Each main part is made of `  Seven:`Dust blessed from Tunare's `  Heaven,`Your hammer, and a metal `  sheet,`Celestial Essence and temper `  meet,`A gem - one from red, green or`  blue,`And finally the correct Mold `  too.`Whether making blade, hilt or `  pommel, choose thy Mold,`And the correct product shall `  ye behold.`The temper of which I have `  said,`Is brewed from Elf-wine, `  coloured red,`Mixed with Magical Essence `  but,`Also add a sprig of the leaf `  that the Sickle shall cut.`From these three can the `  temper be made,`With which this Sickle's game `  is played.`With the offering placed upon `  the fire,`So to the crowd did Summer `  Sirocco retire.	19
RWTLbf4	From the kilns of Kelethin `  came offering third,`A prayer to the Goddess then `  was heard,`From the lips of she named `  Fox's Fyre came,`Hymns sung in the Elf-Queen's `  name.`As the gathering sung in a `  single voice,`Upon the fire was placed the `  Elf druid's choice:`A shining Idol of Tunare, `  golden`From potter's hands, this `  product molden.`Eight constituents for this `  are needed,`To my earlier words I trust ye`  heeded!`Take magic's essence, and `  water flask,`And a sizable block of magical`  clay for this task,`With a sketch of the idol, `  too,`A lump of gold, and Emerald `  Imbue,`With Distilled Mana and your `  sculpting tool,`Place on thy Potter's Wheel, `  as normal rule.`When ready to firm the clay at`  fiery heat,`Use a Godly glaze, and `  adequate firing sheet.`With practiced skill and some `  luck,`From the kiln's flames the `  Idol might you pluck.`Also made by the Potters of `  Kelethin precarious,`Other Idols, for deities `  various.`It is said that each uses a `  differing stone,`Though this is knowledge that `  I do not own.`And so it was that the `  Elf-gifts Three,`Were all upon the fire beneath`  the Great Tree.`The sun that had lit the Grove`  so far,`Sunk beneath the trees, and so`  we saw a Star,`A sign that the Powers' now `  did glance,`Down upon the Congregation's `  dance.	22
RWTLbf5	Next came the Three gifts from`  the race of Man,`Fashioned according to their`  traditional plan.`Workers of strange metals are `  they,`Some in the coldest lands, `  velium workers, they say.`In the manufacture of even the`  smallest bits,`The creation of temper tested `  their wits,`Though now solved, this course`  to thee I show,`So that in the right direction`  might ye go.`Brew together magical essences`  four,`And into that mix a special `  drink then pour:`Created by human settlers in `  the Ice Land,`Explorers, brave adventurers, `  and,`Made from Allspice; water ye ` will also need,`With some brown form of native`  seaweed.`Using a small glass, your `  Heater is created,`Upon which the strongest taste`  buds can be sated!`However, ye will use it to `  mix, as I have said,`With magical essences four, as`  you have read.`"Listen here", said the first `  druid of Man,`"Here is my gift, but I don't `  like your plan!",`With fiery temper, and eyes `  alight,`From the one named Gosselin, `  many took fright.`"There are ways and means for `  druid life,`My way is the right way, all `  else is strife!"`Onto the fire he placed an `  object strange,`'Twas a fishing rod, with `  incredible range.`The Spool was smithed, by the `  look;`Two velium bits and sandalwood`  I think it took.`Then, so strong yet pliant, `  the cord,`What incredible fabric could `  this afford?`Perhaps a cord made entirely `  of silk,`And treated by a tailor, maybe`  in that ilk.`It would take the largest egg `  ye could find,`Then turned into oil, if I `  used my mind.`Use that egg's oil with the `  silk cord, to treat,`That would be the line - it `  would be quite a feat.	16
RWTLbf6	Place the line and the spool `  into a box of tackle,`Then, and this is the part as `  cunning as the jackal,`Add in a single magical `  essence vial,`And a small blessed `  Karana-dust pile.`The fifth and last item to `  place in there,`Is the branch of a sacred tree`  - but from where?`It looks otherworldy, as from `  a spot,`That is of Norrath and mortal `  places not.`From these components five, I `  think one could fashion,`That magical rod, cast on the `  fire with passion.`Unto the crowd, did Gosselin `  glare;`He stepped back, raise to him `  none would dare.`Second from Men came a curious`  Stein,`It certainly looked like `  nothing of mine.`It was as if a Potter had `  taken,`Magical essence, and water if `  I'm not mistaken.`Along with his tools, and a `  ceramic sketched,`With some magical clay and `  then fetched,`A lacquered star ruby, but `  what is this stone?`Perhaps a jeweller could make `  that alone:`A little lacquer, and the gem,`  in his kit;`I'm sure that would be a `  suitable fit.`Use all six on the Potter's `  Wheel,`Then fire in the Kiln, however`  you feel.`Carried by Paldor, a druid so `  tall,`Steins made from other stones `  are within his thrall.`In order to make the sacrifice`  ripe,`Thou shouldst use the star `  ruby type.`And so with a wink Paldor `  retook his place,`Amongst the singing crowd, a `  smile on his face.	11
RWTLbf7	Then came the third and final `  gift of Man,`Brought by Running Wolf, but `  where had he ran?`A strange name for a druid `  fine,`He closely resembled a friend `  of mine.`The gift was a Robe, so well `  made and sewn,`If I were a taller, I'd have `  one of my own!`The neckpiece was silver, `  smithed with skill;`Magical silver, metal bits and`  water to fill.`Then, gems of the primary `  colours and that chain -`A jeweller had clearly crafted`  one main.`With pieces of Tunarean silk -`  perhaps three,`A tailor had sewn the robe, I `  could see,`Also using a pattern, and the `  gemmed chain,`And a magical needle, or I am `  not sane!`Those basic ingrediants six `  went to form,`The luxuriant robe, honourably`  worn.`Upon the magical silk, I then `  did wonder,`A process exact, one cannot `  blunder!`Combining a swatch of silk, `  and magical essence,`And a pinch of Tunarean dust `  would make sense.`The magical needle, now there `  is a thought -`I think from a mold and metal `  bits is it wrought;`Magical essence and water `  don't forget to include,`Then smith in the forge `  whenever is your mood!`So mankind and elfkind their `  gifts had given,`By love of their Gods to their`  arts driven.`A second star appeared `  brightly in the sky,`As if the opening of another `  deity's eye;`And so, to those of Karana's `  humble folk,`To the duty of sacrifice,  `  passion awoke!`Sorrun, brave halfling, he `  held high,`What appeared to be a `  sumptuous pie!`So fitting for the halfling `  kin,`There is no doubt he is far `  from thin!`The pie smelled divine, made `  from good dough,`A good shaped pie tin; the `  filling, though`It seemed familiar, as if it `  were a paste,`Created from vile plants in my`  Caverns, make haste!`Slay them well, and mix them, `  with flour,`And cream and allspice, a `  taste to devour!	15
RWTLbf8	Such a wonderful pie, all the `  halflings agreed,`All eyes on the crust, so `  great was our need!`That gift delivered, it was my`  wish,`To give to Karana our `  customary dish;`My eyes well up, tis how `  strongly I feel,`When I contemplate this epic `  meal.`Listen closely, and I shall `  teach you the making,`Though it requires much study `  of baking!`The Picnic is something that `  we all adore,`One always desires to have `  just a little more!`Eight components there are to `  this feast,`The first, a cheese, is but `  the least.`Add mints, salad and jumjum `  spiced beer,`And two slices of jumjum cake,`  nothing to fear!`A sandwich too, of which you `  shall hear,`And the eighth is a basket, `  bringing up the rear.`The most widely known is the `  jumjum cake,`From usual methods, add `  jumjum, to make!`Mints are simple, and can be `  made by the sheaf,`Just mix frosting with a `  eucalytus leaf!`Now listen closely for brewing`  of spiced beer -`Barley, hops, spices and `  jumjum you shall need near!`Mix in some water, and into a `  bottle pour;`The salad requires ingrediants`  four:`Lettuce, and fennel, `  vegetables and jumjum,`Tasty on its own, sometimes `  nice with rum!`Mix three frostings and a `  fruit portion,`Creates a spread quite lovely,`  use caution!`Mix it with bread and a `  sandwich you'll find,`That's for the picnic, if `  you've been left behind!`Weave two mandrake roots ` together, task it!`Then sew in some boning: your `  picnic basket!`A meal so good, a while it `  takes to eat,`More than food, a religious `  treat!	12
RWTLbf9	The final gift of Karana's `  kind,`What other treat could I `  possibly find?`Something worthy of his `  attention..`What better symbol could I `  mention!`From my backpack I then `  withdrew,`My old talisman, that's seen `  me through,`Adventures of all kinds, when `  I were young,`And with the brave and foolish`  fought among.`The Lucky Cabbage, my faithful`  friend,`That's been with me until the `  end!`And then to the Elder Gods I `  did proffer,`The ninth of Nine, the final `  offer.`A cabbage of your own you can `  enchant,`Sprinkle dust upon the wild `  cabbage plant.`Magical essence, acid, pebble `  from the plains,`To place in the kiln is all `  that remains,`Thus your blessed dust `  created,`Your craving for Lucky Cabbage`  sated!`The fire in the Grove roared `  high,`Its flames touching the ebon `  sky,`The Gods then did upon us `  shine, `What they revealed I shall `  keep mine.`However, you can perhaps try `  too,`By making the Nine, `  sacrificing true,`In a fiery furnace of suitable`  heat,`A smiths forge, perhaps, your `  needs will meet.`Remember that the Gods are `  always looking,`Make well thy sewing, and fair`  thy cooking!`For those of you bold and `  adequately plucky,`Come and try thy skills, if ye`  feelst lucky!`Such endless talk will wear me`  thin.`I shall sleep now, and return `  to my Inn.``- - -`Rebecca Cabbageleaf`The New Thicket Inn	14
RWTmyth	Legend tells of a special `crucible used by the ancients `of the world to magically `transport themselves from `place to place.``We can recreate this effect, `using some heavy clay, `sculpting tools, a bowl `sketch, a spell scroll of `Lesser Succour and just a dab `of celestial essence.`The bowl should be fired with `a glaze to seal in the `scroll's energies.  Use two `portions of opal powder, to `one measure of sarcoscypha `fungus, with one measure of `kunzar glue (kunzar fishbones `baked with water).``Opal powder is created by `firing an opal with some acid.``We are told, also, of magical `rings that cause harm to their`foes.``Perhaps one could try a `lacquered gemstone with water,`a small block of clay, a vial `of cloudy (or clear?) mana and`some celestial essence.  `Shaping the ring should be `easy with sculpting tools.``Lacquering is achieved by `placing a gemstone with some `lacquer into the jeweller's `bag - it should produce the `desired results.``Emeralds, fire opals, pearls, `peridots and opals should work`well for these rings; they `lacquer most well of all gems.```Perhaps most interesting of `all are the myths of stones `blessed by the Gods `themselves, focal points for `their energies.``Reconstruction of such a `device could be achieved with `an idol sketch, a large block `of enchanted clay, celestial `essence, distilled mana, `water, sculpting tools and the`appropriate geographical `essence.``Fire the idol with divine `crystalline glaze.````````Tests have shown that some of `the following make excellent `essences for their regions:``Black Roots, Stonefish, Glow `Lichen, Hatch Dace, Barren `Flounders, Clockwork Koi, `Cinnamon Sticks, Surefall Sap,`Thunder Salmon, Fishing Grubs,`Cactii Pulp, and Sea Salt.```The essence is released by `brewing the base with a little`water.	21
RWTriver	The spirits found me just last night, I must commit the dream to paper.`I saw an sketch of an idol, and clay - was it magical?  There was water, and celestial essence - some other essence too, as well as pure, distilled mana.  Worked with tools, then fired with a holy glaze on a high-quality firing sheet.`That other essence - what was it? It could have been water with Halas turnip, or was it with Deadbone Barley?  Or with the Innothule ground-growers or maybe the Payala Fruit?  What an odd brew.  Not as odd as that skull drink, or that funny Poppin Ale.	0

ScoutPoisons	Expin's Scout Handbook``Animal Poisons`It is sometimes necessary to`put one of Tunare's creatures`to its final rest. There are`several ways to go about the`task, some of which are more`painless than others. The`following are techniques that`I have found particularly`effective.``For small animals grind up`two parts DOGBANE and one`CHUNK OF MEAT in a mortar`and pestle. A LINED POISON`VIAL and SUSPENSION are also`needed. This will produce a`painless but lethal poison`to most small animals.``For larger animals grind up`one part CASTORBEAN and one`part HOUNDS TONGUE, to reduce`the pain, with one CHUNK OF`MEAT. This poison requires a`SEALED POISON VIAL and`CONSTRICT SUSPENSION.``For animals of great size or`maddened by disease grind up`one part BLACK HENBANE, one`part SNAKES HEAD IRIS and one`CHUNK OF MEAT. This poison`requires a SEALED POISON VIAL`and LARENT SUSPENSION.``Crippling Poisons`It is not always necessary to`slay your enemies or other`threatening creatures.`Tunare has blessedly allowed us`the means of temporarily`weakening or blinding an`opponent.``A gritty salve made of SOOT`HEMLOCK, COYOTETAIL, and a`ground up BURNT OUT LIGHT-`STONE will rob a creature of`its sight. A SEALED POISON`VIAL and LARENT SUSPENSION`are needed for storage.``The effects of the venom from`a GIANT WASP VENOM SACK when`combined with two parts`VAMPIRE BAT SALIVA will cause`a delusional mental state but`a side effect is a burst of`adrenaline in the victim. A`POISON VIAL and SUSPENSION`are needed as well.	3

ShamanResearch1	Of Spirit and Mind, A Study`of Shamanistic Ways`By Yuriah Jomsab`Volume I``In the higher echelons of `the study of Enchantment, `one must not only `understand the mind, but `also the spirit.  In my `opinion it is not possible `to become a master of both `realms, save for the Gods `of course.

ShmUQacs	Hear all of Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all.	18
ShmUQaml	The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly.	18
ShmUQawa	Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen, Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us.	18
ShmUQchs	Throughout the history of`   the High Scale it was common`   for the knights to practice`  complete celibacy. It wasn't`  until the controversial Kirn`  was given the hallowed title`  that contact between the `  sexes became tolerated.`  While Kirn wasn't the mightiest`  of the High Scales he was able`  to achieve many great victories`  in the name of our Lord`` of`  Fear. One being the battle`  known as the Bone Rending`  when Kirn lost his fabled`  whip, Thriaxis' Tail, and`  was still able to defeat scores`  of his enemies using his hands`  only. Before this battle ` many believed Kirn could not`  fulfill his duties as a leader`  and patriot for the people.`  However Kirn's might and ``  his lecture on the use of`  females in religious crusade`  and duty convinced the public`  that celibacy had its place`  in divinity but non-celibacy`  also had a place and value`  within the church. A`  shrine depicting Kirn among`  many women was constructed`  in remembrance of his controversial`  reign although his corpse``  was never brought back for`  burial as it was lost far`  across the ocean among distant`  brothers in faith.	18
ShmUQha	Neh`Ashiir's `disappearance will `always be cloaked in `mystery. We of Torsis `have a saying that goes`"Neh's chances." We all `know this is used to `define an innumerable `variable but not many `know of its relation to `the event in the early `years of our fair city. `For as many people as `there were in Torsis `there were that many `theories regarding `Neh`Ashiir's `disappearance. Others `say there were political`tensions between the `queen and her lord, so `much so that she had to `leave to escape death. `And for good measure a `few pointed to the stars `and said that people `from beyond the sky took`her. One thing all agreed`upon however is that the`relationship between `the royal couple was `decaying. Political `scrutinizers noted small `personal habits between `the two that implied a `separation of intimacy `during their public `appearances. Many even `tie the highly `publicized Crusade of `Kirn into the `disappearance of Neh as `Kirn left the city only `a few weeks before. It `is recorded in many `texts that the visage of`Rak'Ashiir reflected `his despair over his `wife's vanishing `although it is a well `known fact that it was `mostly an act played by `the King to keep up his `illusion of nobility. `Perhaps one day we will `find the truth but at `this point it would mean`little to the public.	18
ShmUQkhl	Keeper of the House's log``````  1. New wash basins must be`  acquired. Servant Hujin will`  see the Quartermaster and`  place the order tomorrow.`  2. The chandelier in the main`  hall was finally repaired`  tonight. Payment must be sent`  to the contract holder tomorrow.`   3. Advisor Snith ordered that`  I personally find and acquire`  3 dozen finely made vials.`  What they are for he would`  not explain and was very firm`  that I do this as quickly`  as possible. Best to make`  haste to fulfill the order,`  rumors abound of the Advisor's`  mastery of the arcane.``   4. We've been low on candles`  for the last week. There is`  no explanation for the shortage`  of wax says our civilian contract`  holder. Perhaps I should send`  a Palace Reaver escort with`  the next pick up crew. The`  craftsman may have the`  intelligence to figure the`  symbolism.``   5. It is imperative that we`  return the High Scale's Icon`  to the church as discretely`  as possible. If Rak`Ashiir`  returns from his journey early`  and discovers it was found`  in the royal bedroom it may`  prove disastrous. I cannot`  decide whether to place it`  ourselves with help of our`  Black Guard, or to approach`  one of our contacts in the`  church. The less people that`  know of this the better. It`  might be prudent to ..remove..`  the servant who found it within`  the sheets.	18

ShmUQpdp	I heard last night that there was some kind of commotion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashiir. He is a paragon for the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though.	18
ShmUQprdp	Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his "wisdom" has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wiped out during the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying our church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.	18
ShmUQsl	Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend regularly. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again.	18

And what I now`say, lest shame on my Clan,`is truth.`We had been in the field`hunting for 4 days out of a`scheduled 5 day expedition.`I was scouting at the time`when I heard a tremendous`and angry roar from some`colossal beast. I say as a`Coldain that I was afraid.`The others in my party caught`up to me and heard the beast`as well. Our fear faded with`reassurance in numbers so`we decided to find the source.``After coming over the top of`a small hill we caught sight`of a battle between 5 frost`giants and one dragon of`black scales. We froze in`our tracks at the fearful`sight. We then watched in`horror as the 5 giants, one`gifted with magic, slowly`murdered the dragon with`tactics of heavy dishonor.`Their shaman had restricted`the dragons movement. With`the dragon unable to reach`its attackers, the giants`kept their distance and threw`boulders and spears, while`the shaman used magic. The`giants did not even have the`decency to finish the noble`beast off, leaving him to`die in the snow. We wanted to`interfere, but the giants were`too many.``After the giants had left, I`ran down to the dying dragon,`the others opted to stay`behind. He raised his head,`caked in dragon blood, and`then told me his name and`made me swear to remember`and record it.`I now swear to smith an`axe in remembrance of`him. It will remain in my`clan's posession as long as`there are Coldain.	5
SHRGarzSmith	Only a master smith may forge `the blade.`Once the ore is found, it must`be broken into 2 portions with`a forging hammer and a `smithing chisel.`First you must form the core `of the blade.`Take one portion of the `starmetal and apply the bone `dust in the forge. Then, with `a hammer and chisel, fold the `block of ore. You must repeat `this 5 times to homogenize the`steel. After the 5th fold, `take the hammer to the ore and`shape the core into a curved `blade.``Now for the "skin" of the `blade. Apply the remaining `bone dust to the last portion `of starmetal. Fold this block `of ore, as with the core, 10 `times with the hammer and `chisel. This will be the most `difficult and time consuming `steps. After the 10th fold `block, apply the skin to the `core with the hammer. The last`step in the forging process is`taking the whole blade and `shaping it into a suitable `naginata blade.``The last major step is the `tempering of the blade. This `includes a mixture of clay and`water for the differential `tempering process. Combine a `small block of clay with a `flask of water at the potter's`wheel. Then take the clay and `apply it to the blade at the `wheel as well, leaving the `edge of it exposed. Allow it `to dry.  The last step is to `heat the clay covered blade in`the forge, and then plunge it `into a fluid to temper. In `this case, a special fluid `must be found.`In the mountains of Kunark one`can find a very caustic type `of mist that freezes and `collects at high altitudes. `Find a portion of this ice and`use it for the tempering. Good`luck.`           Eldriaks	22

steelsilk	I recently had the fortune to purchase a strange silk from a traveler hailing from the deserts of Ro. After experimenting for quite some time with the new material I discovered that when sewn into swatches it could be cured with Purified Mana, threaded with Platinum Thread, and using an appropriate pattern tailored into an armor as strong as steel!! One swatch was sufficient to craft a helm, collar, mask, pauldron, or bracer. Two swatches were needed for a waistband, vambraces, gauntlets, or boots. Three swatches were needed for a breastplate, cloak, or greaves.	-1
StonePazt1	The Stone Frum Pazt`By`Gomresh, Shaman of the Dark `Ones```Long ago the shamans of `our ancestor trolls `prophesized the rise of The `Grozmok, referred to more `commonly as The Wun, a Troll `of great might that shall `possess powerful artifacts and`secrets. According to the `prophecies, The Wun shall`subjugate all clans under one`rule.`The might of The Wun and`the united clans under his`rule shall be unstoppable, all`of Norrath shall be ours to `plunder, all its inhabitants `ours to torture and feast `upon.`The shaman of the old `clans recorded the prophecies `of The Grozmok on the `strongest slab of stone, the `hieroglyphs drawn with their `own blood and blessed by the `Gods of Fear and Hate. For `ages our ancestor shaman `guarded the stone, while our `ancestor warriors sought to `subjugate their rival clans, `each hoping to become the `legendary Grozmok. Then, a `great war tore across the face`of Norrath. The minions of the`Warlord Rallos Zek`slaughtered and enslaved`all who crossed their path.`The rivers that fed the`swamps of the ancestor`clans were filled with the `blood of the slaughtered. Many`of the ancestor clans were `destroyed in the chaos, the `survivors becoming scavengers,`feeding on the carnage of the `battlefield, or slaves, `fighting along side the very `armies that led to their clans`demise. During this time the `Grozmok Stone was lost, `pillaged and hidden within one`of the strongholds of the `Rallosian Empire.`The Empire of the Ogres `fell abruptly, cursed by the `Gods to be reduced lower than`the state peoples they had `conquered. The remnants of `the ancestor clans once again `began to flourish, new clans `rose to replace those that had`been lost to the slaughter of `the Rallosian Empire. Two `tribes in particular gained `dominance of the ancestor `Trolls, the Brokenskull Clan `who inhabit an Island in the `Gulf of Gunthak, and the `Ykesha Clan residing in the `Innothule Swamps. The two`clans warred against each `other for supreme dominance`of southern Tunaria, raiding`the others territories and`the mountainous lands`of the Ogres that had`survived the destruction`of their empire. `It was in these mountainous `lands that the Grozmok Stone `once again came into `possession of the Troll Clans.`	6
StonePazt2	A war horde from the Ykesha `Clan recovered the Grozmok `Stone from the ruins of an `Ogre Stronghold. Recognizing `the hieroglyphs of the `ancestor clans but not being `able to decipher them, the `stone was given the name `"Stone Frum Pazt" and `presented to the Warlord `Ykesha, ruler of their clan. `Ykesha's shamans recognized`the blessings of the Gods of `Fear and Hate upon the `hieroglyphs, and calling upon `them for divine assistance `deciphered the meaning of the `words scrawled in blood`across the surface of the`stone. `Ykesha believed he was, or `desired to be The Wun, and`his accomplishments coupled`with the prophesies of the`Stone Frum Pazt rallied`even more trolls to the`Ykesha Clan.`As Ykeshas' might and `renown grew, so did his `paranoia until he hid himself `deep within his fortress in `the Innothule Swamp. The `forces of the rival clans, all`seeking possession of the `Stone Frum Pazt beset the `Ykesha Clan. It was Clan`Brokenskull that won `possession of the stone, the `Ykesha Clan was destroyed,`the survivors joining their`one-time rivals or fleeing`into the swamps, clanless`and disgraced.`The clanless trolls endured`in the Innothule swamp`despite their disgrace, and a`new Warlord by the name of `Jurglash rose and united the`remnants of the Ykeshan Clan.`This new clan became known`as the Grobb Clan, and its`might would quickly grow to`become the prominent troll`clan on the Antonican`mainland.`Eventually the Warlord `Redak, a powerful`shadowknight of the`Brokenskull Clan, rose to`power and claiming the`mantle of The Wun led the `Brokenskulls to victory over `several smaller clans residing`on the mainland of Antonica. `The Shaman had heard of a `place of great evil called `Befallen, and sent Redak`alone to this place to` recover powerful artifacts,`and fulfill his destiny.`Redak did as the shaman` instructed and was never`seen nor heard from again.`The stone remained in `the possession of the `Brokenskull Clan, hidden and `guarded in the tomb of the `legendary Brokenskull`Shaman, Nadox.`For decades the Grobb Clan`prospered under the`leadership of Warlord`Jurglash, their shaman `dedicated themselves to`the Gods of both Fear and `Hate. The Shadowknights of `Grobb built the Nightkeep in `the Innothule swamp, on the `edge of the clans' village, `and Da Bashers had become`a force to be feared.` Only the Brokenskulls`remained as a threatening`rival clan.`The Shaman of Grobb`learned the whereabouts`of the Stone Frum Pazt`and an invasion horde was`sent to recover it from the`rival clan. The invasion was `successful and the stone was `brought to Grobb where it `remains, awaiting the arrival `of The Wun.`	6

It was`+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+``+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+`apparent that he had been `without food for some time. `The orphan was very near death`when Kerran hunters found him `and brought him back to their `village. ``The Shir tribe adopted the `child and nursed him back to`+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+``+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+`health.  The tribe searched `for some trace of his family, `but did not succeed in finding`them.

After several years`of searching all efforts`+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+``+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+`to find his family were `officially ended and the boy `was adopted into the tribe. `That is when they gave him the`name Taruun.

Sonic`Wolf Bane Poison is made from:`salass moss, tortoise saliva, `sonic wolf blood, and poison `dart felt from the dart of a `grunt shaman.

The`warlords agreed thinking`his challenge an easy task.`` Grandmaster Tynn quickly`dispatched the warlords`with nothing more than fist`and tail. He fought in a`way never displayed. His `victory earned him much `respect and Emperor Sathir`soon commanded him to `form the Court of Pain and`raise an army of monks. `Tynn formed the Swifttail`Caste.` Soon the way of fist and`tail had hundreds in its`ranks, climbing the rungs.`Tynn showed them they were`not warriors, but monks. `They would don shackles as`testament to the Age of `Snake when the Iksar were`a race enslaved.

tinkering1	From the notes of Gimblestan, `First Assistant to King `Ak-'Anon the XVII, `Master of the Tinkering Arts.`Volume XI``As previously mentioned, the `fishing expedition had been `planned for second-week, with `a prize going to he clan that `could pull the most fish from `the waters of our beloved Lake`Tildunk.  How could we resist `such a contest?``It was a given that we would `use our superior intellect to `come up with a better way to `win the competition.  Snivlin `suggested the use of `underwater explosives, `claiming that we could catch `the fish once they floated to `the surface.  This was `immediately voted down by the `committee, since other groups `might grab the fish we had `used such innovation to catch.`I myself was leery, `remembering the accident at `the FIREWATER storage facility`from the previous week.  It `seems some young gnome, `wanting to make FIREWORKS, had`fixed the wrong ratio of water`to gnomish spirits, resulting `in unstable fuel for the `fireworks.  When she later `attached the bat wings to the `metal shaft, the unstable `firewater ignited prematurely,`sending the firework screaming`into the storage facility.``The new storage cavern was a `welcome addition to our city.``The committee finally decided `upon a gadget of my own humble`design for the contest:`ANIMATED BAIT.  Armed with `bits of cork and sprikets, we `assembled mass quantities of `this new style bait.``The final piece of work for `the contest, and my personal `favorite, is the COLLAPSIBLE `FISHING POLE.  Using three `metal rods and some gnomish `bolts, I tinkered together a `fishing pole that would fit `inside of my belt pouch.``It was a good day to be a `gnome.`	-1
tinkering2	From the notes of Gimblestan, `First Assistant to King Ak-'Anon the XVII, Master of the`Tinkering Arts.`Volume XIV``Today our party embarked upon`a quest of high adventure,`setting out to catch that most`elusive of prey, the crafty`minotaur.  Zookeeper Visgig`had posted a rich reward for a`live capture - I believe that`he is looking for a new zoo`exhibit.  The rest of my party`seemed to be interested in the`money; my reason was to field-`test my latest inventions.``Once into the Steamfont`Mountains, I produced the`first of my new toys, a`portable location detection`unit.  I call it a COMPASS,`after my wife Compassvna,`who never can seem to orient`her way anywhere.  The design`is quite simple.  Taking a`pie tin, I filled it with a`flask of water.  After`running a static orb over an`old skewer, I stuck the`skewer into a cork and`placed it in the pie tin. `The others were quite`impressed with the`functionality.``Journal Note: Transvin`suggested a new device, a`MECHANICAL LOCKPICK.`I think this could be`accomplished quite easily.`Materials to try - lockpicks,`gears, sprockets.  Perhaps a`rat ear, for use in the`amplification of the sound.`Must try to make one when we`return.``As night approached, I`brought out my FLAMELESS`TORCH.  Yet another simple`device I am surprised nobody`else thought of.  Taking a`large lantern, I removed the`regular fuel system and`replaced it with a flask of`firewater.  Wrapping it with`metal twine produces a`gentle light, as the heat`from the firewater causes`the twine to glow.``Our hunting party was very`appreciative.``As we approached the minotaur`settlement, our warriors`unstrung their bows.`Jarnikiv, Master Fletcher,`had provided us with a new`type of composite bow, one`using CAMS.  The gears and`gnomish bolts, once greased,`gave our composite bows`range superior to our old`recurve bows.  With these`ready we crept stealthily`through the night.  Transvin,`scouting ahead, reported the`far-off sound of minotaur`singing.``[CONTINUED]`	-1
tinkering3	From the notes of Gimblestan, `First Assistant to King Ak-'Anon the XVII, Master of the`Tinkering Arts.`Volume XV``[CONTINUED]``On a personal note, the chill`which I felt creep up my spine`had nothing to do with the`poor operating quality of my`THERMAL CLOAK.  It has`continued to function quite`well.  The firewater flask,`carefully positioned on my`belt, causes no hindrance to`my movement, and the metal`rods sewn into the tattered`gnomish cloak conduct the`heat quite well.``Transvin motioned for us to`extinguish our lights.`Kneeling down, I handed him`my new SPYGLASS to look`through.  It seems to be`working rather well.  He`laughed at first, mistaking`the body of my old`collapsible fishing pole.`Once he peered through the`reflective shard, all jibing`stopped.  I believe that this`is one of by best works yet.`The extra metal rod gives it`a good shell, while the`bottle and the metal twine`hold and amplify the image`seen through the reflective`shard.``Once Transvin had scouted the`terrain, we all hooked our`STALKING PROBES to him.  I`love these things - and wish`I had thought them up first.`Another example of superior`gnomish technology.  The only`danger comes from putting`firewater on a scout.  The`two sets of gears, hooked to`the metal rod and bottle pose`no danger in and of themselves.`I am worried, however, that`one day a scout will burst`into flames as she lures`prey back to us.``Such are the hazards of`innovation.```We have dubbed our minotaur`Binky.`	-1
tinkering4	From the notes of Gimblestan, `First Assistant to King Ak-'Anon the XVII, Master of the`Tinkering Arts.`Volume XXXIII.``Although I'm sure they were`sad to see us leave, the`human crew who had brought us`out into the Ocean of Tears`must have been very excited`about our expedition as they`eagerly tossed us into the`lifeboat that would serve as`our base. As we dove deeper`into the chilly waters I`noticed Nantik was turning a`much deeper shade of blue`than normal. It was then that`I realized his AQUALUNG must`be out of air. He had`cleverly assembled this`breathing apparatus using`fine coral mesh attached to a`silk lined steel helm with`some metal twine and gnomish`bolts. A metal rod served as`the mouthpiece, with gills`from a fresh fish inserted`to filter the water. A quick`tug on his support wire shot`him upwards where he managed`to project a respectable`20ft from the surface before`landing near the boat.`Hopefully I would have no`such trouble as I had just`recently made some`modifications to his`breathing device producing an`upgraded version, which I`named a REBREATHER. Using`Nantik's original aqualung, I`applied a lime coated meshing`to absorb the unbreathable`gases I expelled. The`sharkskin tubing connected`the medium sized platemail`helm I was using to an extra`supply of firewater and was`held on tightly by a metal`fastening. This allowed me to`effectively use the same`supply of air for a great`deal of time. As we reached`the wreckage of the sunken`vessel I was mindful to`pickup a few pearls for my`friend Simpkin the jeweler.`He had just finished the`initial design on his`GEMCUTTER and was interested`in using it to make those`wonderful pearl anaglyphs he`is so fond of. By using a`metal rod coated in diamond`dust and held to a cam by a`metal fastening, his`firewater powered apparatus`was able to make precise cuts`in even the tiniest gems`while only requiring a small`bit of grease to reduce`friction. At last we were`ready to begin the salvage`operation.[CONTINUED]	-1

TomeOfAges3	`It came to pass some years`later that a small group of`Erudites discovered the lost`art of Necromancy.  They were`branded heretics and great`conflict arose. For the first`time in several hundred years,`the Erudites fought. They`engaged in a civil war not`entirely dissimilar to that`which they had loathed and`fled back on the mainland.`But there was one`very significant difference -`they did not use swords and`bows, but rather magic, and`the result was terrible.`Lives by the hundreds were`lost, great buildings and`structures destroyed, and`eventually the heretics were`forced to flee Erudin, to`hide and regroup in the`southern regions of Odus. In`one final battle, great mystic`energies were released and an`immense hole leading to`unknown depths beneath the`earth was created.  Into the`sides of this chasm the`heretics built their own city`which they called Paineel.`And while both sides still`seethed with anger and hatred`toward one another, their`fear of what the last battle`had wrought has kept any`further conflict at bay.``Thus began the Age of Turmoil.`	4

TSRRiz	Jiva the Reckless rests now that his work is done.\
\
With the knowledge afforded to him by wise Arlyxir he was able to create a tear in the planes between the Tower of Solusek Ro and The Plane of Fire. Arlyxir has always been trusted go-between for Solusek and his father Fennin. However, Arlyxir has decided to form alliance with Solusek.\
\
The decision of direct confrontation against the populace of Norrath was not an easy one to make. They both know that Fennin would not agree to such a hostile act, because the Pantheon would not condone it.\
\
After many hours of incantations a great well marked with runes of fame appeared and began to pour the very essence of the Plane of Fire into The Tower. The Guardians of Dresolik, the Great Shard, watch over the pulsating crystal has it harnesses the power being syphoned from the Plane the Fire. Only time stands between us now. Those that I once walked with soon learn of the mistakes in their transgressions.\
\
I can hear Xuzl in his Tower, always working on his conjurings. The crackle of the animated regiment of flaming swords can be deafening. Xuzl does not take any time to rest; for he knows as will all do that the time draws near.\
\
Greater fiends has been constructed by Solusek to spread their curse upon any that survive the initial destructive force from Dresolik. The seven fiends will be generals of the army being conjured by Xuzl. Solusek has also placed his trust in two elemetals. These elementals have coalesced into the form of wyverns. I must say that I am quite partial to their new forms, and have formed a kinship with them. Together with them we will exterminate any dragonkind that are resistant enough to flame to save them from onslaught that Dresolik will provide. Dresolik pulses with extreme power, it will soon be powerful enough to scorch Norrath. I can only hope that my voice and praise of Solusek will be enough to give the others the strengh needed to continue.	0

Now begin to work on the `Velium Rings that will link `the pieces of the armor `together.  To make a set of `rings, place a Large Brick of `Velium into the forge and heat`it up a bit.  Take a metal `file and file off small pieces`and shape them into a circular`shape.  Cool them in a Vial of`Coldain Velium Temper to `strengthen them.``3. Take a break from the hot `forge and prepare to fashion `the Soft Fur Padding which `will be placed on the inside `of the armor.  The fur will `serve as comfort and to keep `the body warm.  The softest `fur is found from Velium `Hounds, take a patch of their `fur and sew it into patterns `that will fit inside the `armor, use Silver Thread to `accomplish this.``4. The preparations are now `complete.  You can now begin `to fashion the armor.  Use a `Velium Smithy Hammer to `hammer the Folded Velium `Sheets into a Plate Mold.  `Once the Sheet has been `hammered into the mold, begin `attaching the Velium Rings to `the outer areas of the armor `piece that will connect to `other pieces.  Then begin `attaching the Soft Fur Padding`to the insides of the armor `piece.  For creating the `Bracer and Boots you will need`one Folded Velium Sheet.  For `the Vambraces, Gauntlets, and `Helmet you will need two `Folded Velium Sheets.  For the`Breastplate, and Greaves you `will need three Folded Velium `Sheets to fill the mold.	0
VelArmor2	Royal Forge of Icewell `Precious Gem Study V.1`----------------------`Now that the armor is created `you can begin to set a gem `within it.  We have found `three gems that when faceted `will seem to add an aura that `radiates from the armor.  It `is our firm belief that Brell `himself is pleased with the `fusion of Ore and Mineral and `bestows powers unto the armor.` Three different gems are used`in the process of creating `this armor: Diamonds, `Emeralds, and Sapphires.  `These are not normal gems that`circulate through the economy;`these are gems pulled from the`raw ore and faceted to draw `upon its powers.  To facet the`unrefined gem you will first `need a set of etching tools to`chip away the raw edges. Place`the gem firmly in your jewelry`kit and slowly chip away at `all sides until a nice smooth `edge is formed.  When you have`finished with the lapidary `place the piece of armor you `wish to work on in your `jewelry kit.  Use your etching`tools to form a base for the `gem to fit in.  Then place the`gem in the base you just `created and you are finally `done.  The optimum effect of `gems has been found as the `follows: Diamonds for the `Breastplate and Greaves, `Sapphires for the Vambraces `and Bracers, and Emeralds for `the Boots, Gauntlets, and `Helmets.	0

VenrilChief	Venril Sathir `      of the Kunzar` The greatest lizard to walk`upon the land was Venril `Sathir of the Kunzar tribe.`All that is known of his `youth was that he was a `member of the ancient Kunzar`Tribe. This was during the `time of division among the `tribes of the Iksar. He was `said never to have been a `mere broodling. He was `forever a master of combat.` Venril would soon slay his`father and take his rightful`place as chief of the Kunzar`Tribe. He led the Kunzar on `many expeditions into the `ruins and wilds of Kunark.`He sought knowledge and `weapons. ``` In his late youth he found `the hidden library of the`necromancer, Kotiz. He would`come to open a large book `which opened into a small`room. Climbing into the book`he found a floating book. `The Unholy Writ of War was`its title. Made of Iksar `skins, it contained great`knowledge of combat. Venril`became the book's master.` Venril soon showed signs of`dark knowledge. He began to`wield the forces of the dark`circle and his knowledge of `combat tactics became `supreme. He trained his army `new tactics and even raised `the bones of the fallen to `fight yet again for their `masters. His army grew and`marched to all corners of `Kunark.` Venril Sathir's army is now`unstoppable. He shall soon `plot the union of the entire`Iksar nation. He no longer`wishes to be just Chief, but`rather, Emperor. Under his`direction the four remaining`tribe states of the Iksar `shall unite and a new age `shall dawn.``           313 A.G.	-1

WarUbNote	Written by`Kargek Redblade the Seventh.``Long ago our ancestor Thegrek`the first was on the`battlefield as a companion of`Surtelk.  With his might and` quickness he slew many goblin`warriors that day as did `Surtelk with the help of his `magical blades.  When the`great warrior went insane and`was slain by our lord Rallos `Zek the blades of Surtelk `were spread across Norrath `until a true warrior who `could control the blades came`forth.  Rallos Zek himself `took the great Red Scabbard`and handed it to Thegrek.

ZeroBG	Before Green `This is known as the Age `of the Snake. The snake `race known as Shissar, `slithered upon Kunark.`The Iksar had yet to `unite. Our people had yet`to learn the Black Arts and`the ways of Fist and Tail.`Divided, the Iksar were`enslaved by the snakes.`In the centuries before the`Green, the Iksar were `slaves of the Shissar `They ruled from the ancient`city of Chelsith which rested`deep within the land now `known as The Overthere.`From there would sprout much`evil. The Iksar were `tortured like Frogs and`suffered at the hands of`the Shissar. The Iksar who`showed genius were to help`the snakes in their dark `rites. These few were the `seeds of rebellion. The`Iksar began to plot a `revolt, but a greater force`would strike first. The `Shissar were an arrogant `race. The power bestowed by`the gods was not enough. `They made pacts with other `gods and demigods. They `found the rifts of time and`space and used them to `gather magic items once `held by the guardians of`the planes. The Shissar's`disloyalty and blasphemous`pride would bring the wrath`of the gods upon them. No`power could stop the force `to come. A green cloud `formed in the skies above`Kunark. The cloud began to`descend upon the land. From`its green core the face `of death began to form. It`was of no god they knew.`It opened its giant maw `and spoke in tongues `unknown. From the mouth of`death rushed forth a green`mist. The Shissar shamans `began to cast spells in `hopes of shielding their `city and the necromancers `began to assault the mist `with great spells. All were`futile. The mist rushed `forth. The first snakes to`be swallowed by the mist `had their scales and flesh`rot and fall from their`bones. Horrid screams of`suffering could be heard`from within the mist. A river`of flesh and blood flowed.`The Iksar stood and gazed`upon the gristle that was`once the Shissar. With the`Green Death came the `liberation of the Iksar.`The season is now 0 A.G.,`After Green.	-1
